When I say ‚ÄúI stay up super late aha!‚Äù It‚Äôs not because I want to, it is rather due to the fact that I run through all the ways I could possibly be actively dying and have no idea and then I work myself into a panic that I have an undiagnosed disease ravaging my body
@JWWare75 @Greytizi7 @tylercortez_ @DanBlue528 @babyitsjustfait @JordanUhl I haven't heard of it before, but it seems like he had an undiagnosed disease, that's tragic.

I know I go on the same rant at least once a month but it really gets under my skin. Justin struggled for a year and a half because of an undiagnosed disease, gets a diagnosis, is brave enough to share it with millions of people then gets made fun of and bullied for having ticks

Now that we have examined the strange death of Joan Rivers, here is the autopsy report on an even STRANGER death, Lori Klausutis, a 28 year old woman whom they say had an undiagnosed heart condition (she ran 8K marathons though). Exhumation anyone?
@sickanddamned I had these symptoms for a long time, and it turned out part of the problem was undiagnosed whiplash, so physio untangled that and no more of those symptoms and don't need traction anymore. Still have lots of other problems from Lyme though.

@OfficialRita @charitynopanic My 8 year old daughter takes sertraline for severe OCD and anxiety. She has #pandas, a cruel autoimmune condition which 95% of GPs are unaware of. Undiagnosed children become adults, some of whom will end their own lives. Please rt. @PandasPans
#MeAt20 got me looking through old photos.. complete with (probably) cider, Hello Kitty watch, rainbow button necklace, baggy dress and blazer done up to hide my body shape, and tights and boots because that was "my thing"... And suffering from undiagnosed severe PTSD. My child. https://t.co/PxusjypZwh
This is exactly why I spoke about me suffering from Crohn's Disease very publicly. Ever since then, more than 40 people approached me and told me they were suffering from similar symptoms but have gone undiagnosed for years because doctors couldn't figure out why or- https://t.co/KvlOqhfiTn
@twanderingheart In the 5 years I have been investigating my undiagnosed digestive issues I have gone from a purely western "traditional medicine" approach to where I am now, 1000 tests later, taking four different supplements daily that I buy off the internet. If it works, it works!!

@DitzMcGeee Hope so.. A friend's kid has mastocytosis AND tuberous sclerosis, somehow. Known folks with all sorts of things that come with compromised or reduced immune systems, or have other issues. Tbh, it wouldn't even matter if I knew someone personally, I'd still be worried about that..
I have MS &amp; my grandsons live with me the 5 yr old has Mastocytosis
@EmLyWill @bendy_thumbs @Cheryl_Quist Yeah, wow. I love it because I get to drink water again without throwing up. I might do different since I have systemic mastocytosis and not MCAD. Even though I'm used to it, the different reactions people have to the same meds for similar conditions still blow me away.

People at my school be such kiss-asses. Our professor had dysphonia so she has someone else teaching her slides while she clarifies.
Due to a neurological condition called spasmodic dysphonia and treatments for it, I might sound a little different every time you hear me speak.
Kennedy Jr suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, which makes him difficult to listen to.  He is not anti-vaccine he is pro-safe-vaccines.  Listen from 18.16 - 28.32.  Diabetes, autism, allergies are caused by UNTESTED vaccines. Children today are supposed to take 72.
Alhumdulilah Alhumdulilah Alhumdulilah! He tolerated thick liquids today, got NG tube out, dysphonia slightly improved and was able to get up to a chair! All thanks to everyone‚Äôs prayers! Please pray he continues to build on these small steps daily iA #ŸÜÿØŸäŸÖ_ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿ¥Ÿä
@JordanPeele @UsMovie ‚Ä¢ Did you know? @Lupita_Nyongo based the voice of Red's character on a neurological disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. She was inspired to do so after reading a line in the script, which stated that "She (Red) had not used her voice in many years.".
@worthdesigning @LaLaRueFrench75 He has a disorder called Spasmodic dysphonia that causes the shaky voice.
@Pituitary_org @hormone_doc I have panhypopituitarism and my endo has said that my chronic fatigue is all in my mind..is this the case?
@pebblesbythesea @Pituitary_org @hormone_doc I also have panhypopituitarism and suffer from chronic fatigue my endocrinologist is very supportive it has to do with your hormone levels.
@JuanPeirano I know I  don't!  The steroids I take for panhypopituitarism make me crave more sugar especially after eating something higher in carbs.
condition called Panhypopituitarism, which means that my pituitary gland doesn‚Äôt produce enough of/any of the hormones it is supposed to normally. For example, it is why I had to be treated with synthetic HGH as a child because I wasn‚Äôt growing. In ‚Äò10 I went to @BrandonRegional
IV pain medicine, and some ‚Äústress dosing‚Äù steroids b/c I was having an adrenal crisis due to my Panhypopituitarism (FYI, this was @ about 12:30 AM). She was finally successful &amp; they set me up with IV fluids, strong pain medication, etc. The GI on duty that AM @ @BrandonRegional
I got hypopigmentation on my nose any suggestions from my skin sisters/brothers!!!!???????
‚ÄúWhat can I do to treat hypopigmentation?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt have enough characters but basically another laser can be used to reverse laser induced hypopigmentation. Have you dermatologist check out the hypopigmentation always and wear your SPF ‚ù§Ô∏è
@MakeupForWOC im hoping mine goes away. i struggled with eczema for so long just to have hypopigmentation sit in its place??? and it‚Äôs on my face too im tired
@MakeupForWOC I see people are getting hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation mixed up in your tweet replies. ü§î Hypopigmentation is areas of skin that are lighter than everywhere else lol.
I have hypopigmentation, basically my skin loses its pigment when heavily exposed to UV rays (due to melanin depletion). It‚Äôs cosmetic and the only way I can get ‚Äúrid‚Äù of it is by whitening my skin which I was against.

I had a child who had hypotonia and the harness allowed me to pull her up before she fell. It helped her build much needed muscles, &amp; the confidence &amp; security to walk w/o the pain associated of skinned knees &amp;  hands. Does ‚Äúreligion‚Äù make people lazy when it comes to judgement?
I hate not being able to do the same things my other percussionist friends can do because of dyspraxia and hypotonia
@painandcats_ I get it. My hypotonia presented as severe to the point it looked like the conditions I was misdiagnosed with. So I‚Äôm not angry or annoyed at all cos my type of EDS is extremely rare. And everyone went out of their way to diagnose me correctly. But yeah that‚Äôs my story üôÇ

@RoopinderDr @Chemokine_R yes I have, and oddly it was in dating a women who I believed to have had undiagnosed BPD that led me to double binds which led me to dialectical behaviour therapy which led me back to, you guessed it, Hegel. but actually, fear of abandonment is at the root of nearly everything
4 seperate mental health professionals: yeah your daughter almost certainly has a serious undiagnosed anxiety disorder 
That said, I'm sure I was undiagnosed Bipolar all during my early to mid adult years. I am by comparison quite ready steady now.  Cheers
@RealMarkLatham @aaron_kalgoorle If this premise was true, @RealMarkLatham would be so far left that he‚Äôd be considered a communist. But, he‚Äôs just a narcissist with an undiagnosed mental health issue.
@reallyruth @thespybrief my right arm has been numb since I am pretty sure I had it (undiagnosed.) I was thinking it was carpal tunnel from my twitter use while stuck at home lol. But I have increasingly become a little more worried.
Nothing beats getting older and realizing all the things I used to get irrationally mad at and beat myself up over not making sense was all because I was undiagnosed.
The reason I went undiagnosed is bc I had the symptoms as a teen, it was passed as bad periods. They put me on a high estrogen bc pill - which I was on all the way until pregnancy with my daughter. Pregnancy suppresses the symptoms for 2-3 years. It is now making itself known.
Can't sleep thinking about my uncle if he's alright. Been chatting w/ my cousin, didn't realise things were so bad. His diabetes has gone undiagnosed &amp; got complicated

My ARFID got worse as I wasn't given treatment. I was undiagnosed and not believed. My doctors looked at me patronizingly when I told them I didn't have anorexia. My eating disorder does not come from a desire to be thin. It comes from the insecurity around what i eat-

Does anyone else go though random episodes where they feel the need to clean and decorate everything immediately and can‚Äôt stop until it‚Äôs done or do I just have an undiagnosed mental disorder
@JacobWolinsky Sounds like he may have an undiagnosed brain tumor.
@AdinaWollam Imagine how fun that was as a kid with chronic migraines, a wheat allergy and undiagnosed Crohn's disease. First doc visit as an adult. The answer to everything was "pray about it." So yeah. Good times.
