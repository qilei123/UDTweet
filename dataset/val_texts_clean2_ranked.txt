Went several years with undiagnosed astigmatism because my previous eye doctor told me it was either a mental issue (because of my ADHD) or a weight issue. In my case, a lot of stuff comes back to my mental health or being fat.
As someone whos undiagnosed ADHD wrecked my life because neither me nor my parents thought it was real, kindly stfu unless youre a doctor.
being a doctor is a mixed bag. i get a headache and i think "oh no big deal, just dehydrated" but suddenly i think what if i have undiagnosed AIDS and its so advanced i developed CNS toxoplasmosis
Id get it checked out. My mom had terrible periods. Thought it was normal. In hindsight, I think she may have had undiagnosed endometriosis or something. At any rate, she had secondary infertility and I think they were related. Get it checked out and get some help for the pain.
Unfortunately I have multiple examples of chiari and #eds! We are hypochondriacs- stressed- fat- attention seeking- depressed/ anxious- even when diagnosed ignored or hidden my mri result not told me for 10 years til I almost died!
You work your ass off to become a psychotherapist despite being undiagnosed with multiple sclerosis for most of your life.  Then when youre finally diagnosed, everyone loses their fucking shit - especially the people you are taught to believe are supposed to help you.
Some of you have undiagnosed dyslexia and adhd but your parents beat you and called you olodo. Try one session of therapy and then come back and tell me that youre okay , the way youll unpack will shock you to a stupor .

i do well with routine but poorly with creating my own cause im out here w undiagnosed adhd (was working on a diagnosis when this quarantine hit lmaooo) but i might try to make a schedule or something today... idk bc then i get all panicky about Failing At The Schedule
...severe clinical depression, anxiety, and possible undiagnosed adhd makes everything sm harder for me. and for a lot of people going through similar things. the audacity to assume that because we're kids we don't have any issues or other things going on right now is absurd. ...
Currently undiagnosed but have a lot of lupus symptoms ANA is borderline so considered negative. Anyone out there have ANA negative Lupus or diagnoses with lupus-like disease? Have currently ruled out MS with an MRI. Upcoming X-rays to look for RA.
Over the years I had a couple of patients referred to me on call with 'acute anxiety'. They turned out to be hyperventilating due to sepsis, severe pain from a dislocated shoulder and DKA in undiagnosed T1DM needing to go straight to ITU.
Oh gosh, thats a lot to take in! As someone who has struggled with undiagnosed health issues I bet finding that out was relieving, albeit confusing! I found out this year in addition to anxiety + depression I have hEDS, which comes with CF, fibromyalgia, POTS etc.
Undiagnosed #ADHD often leads to #Depression or/and #Anxiety. Also, people are often wrongly diagnosed, especially with depression, when they actually have ADHD. I was thought to be depressed, but it was ADHD behind my challenges all along.
In this new day and age you have to have an overly aggressive self esteem. People will really try and break you down because they have an undiagnosed disorder and some mommy/daddy issues. Listen a therapy session is less than some yeezys bruh
It's hard for anyone to understand. Although undiagnosed I categorically had depression as a  young teen, if not before. Dad would just say "Snap out of it" and Mum "if you don't have a reason to be sad, don't be sad". It's not just kids, it can be anyone. (1/2)
Starting to think ya boi's got undiagnosed adhd or something similar but I can't check because I can't leave the g o d d a m n h o u s e, let alone go to a doctor lmao
Hey! Just wanted to say I grew up with a narcissistic father, undiagnosed of course, but absolutely had NPD. It fucked me up, but years  of therapy has helped. But, I cant ever   did the residue of self-doubt, anxiety, feeling like a burden, alienation, etc.
Oh my, I'm sorry to hear. Mine was just clouded by undiagnosed adhd and diagnosed depression so. Different issues but still
Im fairly certain I have undiagnosed adhd and I feel like I shouldnt relate to this but Ive felt like this my whole life and this online school shit is only highlighting it even more
cant stop thinkin abt.. how bc my bpd went undiagnosed for SO LONG and i wasnt properly medicated for my bipolar for years i was so suicidally sad abt a lot of things for a vv long time and not only did i hurt myself but i also hurt other people bc of it
Many kids are suffering from dyslexia but because its undiagnosed in Africa, it is automatically assume a child is an olodo. Before you get physical with your child cos they failed, try finding out. Dont be your parents, this is not about being woke.

so now she's hallucinating LIKE FUCK cuz she learned to be ocd and bulimic about controlling her undiagnosed schizophrenia???? omfgawd I AM CRINGINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG #natalieportman acted her gawd damn ass off geezus fucking gawd #blackswan
Been an undiagnosed writer therapist of therapy meaning I get luke anxiety and that's the bad thing 
Could be undiagnosed, was in therapy for 8 years  I couldnt find a provider who took my obsessions or fixating seriously. almost diagnosed ADHD but the providers wanted to urine test me for pot if they prescribed meds/diagnosed me. hope to get down to the bottom of it one day
"I don't know who I am without my maladaptive coping mechanisms for undiagnosed ADHD  I'm having an identity crisis" is a summary of the last 8 months for me and how dare  call me out like this on their podcast!!! 
This is. Snippet of having two undiagnosed people in the house who both definitely either have Adhd or autism. But we wont be taken seriously as we are female. Well Ivy is NB but doctors dont care. Seeing my kid suffer exactly as I did as a kid is so hard and I cant even help
i am so so sorry to hear that stephen. i, myself, was undiagnosed in my first attempt and im currently trying to prevent something similar, a friend of mine is undiagnosed and suicidal and i completely understand how difficult it can be to a) recognise you need help + b) be able
Understand. My wife's Parkinson's went undiagnosed for years because of medical ignorance until a well-informed nurse picked up on it. Was subjected to all kinds of unnecessary 'treatments'.
Anyway. More adventures on why are my emotions like this/g-d I need to get back to therapy but cannot and our newer show - is this the result of undiagnosed ADHD or a lifetime of unprocessed trauma memories and stress? 
So pissed off with this not-unsubscribable covid 19 psych survey I signed up to. Realised in the initial questionaire it was fundamentally flawed cos it (a) ignored undiagnosed / untreated mental illness (NHS is SHIT*) and (b) other psychological factors happening simultaneously
Listen my mom once asked my doctor about it cause Id be doing it SO OFTEN and he just said oh its normal p sure I have ADHD thats been undiagnosed for this long
I am also this person, my husband has the patience of a saint. In my defence Im dyslexic, I suspect I have an undiagnosed co-morbidity...but Im coming to the very sad conclusion that I might be a total dick. Im not going to lie, its a bitter pill to swallow.
When I say I stay up super late aha! Its not because I want to, it is rather due to the fact that I run through all the ways I could possibly be actively dying and have no idea and then I work myself into a panic that I have an undiagnosed disease ravaging my body

No wonder Asswalt's first wife overdosed. They said it may have been accidental  she had an undiagnosed heart condition, but considering she lived with him...frig, I'd be taking Adderall, Xanax,  Fentanyl, too.
This past month , one of my friends suddenly died of a pulmonary embolism; he was undiagnosed. Another died of a massive stroke after seemingly improving from COVID. What a vicious virus.

And let's not forget the people having cancers etc undiagnosed, treatments not carried out properly, scans etc not done, operations cancelled !! Not to mention the mental health issues this lockdown will cause !
The doc that diagnosed me specializes in studying how under-diagnosed autism is in marginalized communities and how support can be there for undiagnosed people. Youre all thinking this is some gotcha and its not. My GP even said diagnosis may not help literally anything.
Totally. She had two babies 12 months apart and my mum always thought she had undiagnosed/untreated postpartum depression a theory that definitely stands up. Too many people forcing her into things she didnt want to do and not being well mentally = breakdown. 
RT def have brain damage from quarantine or maybe it was the undiagnosed ADHD that I have been dealing with since age 9
Yes my father had leukaemia from mastocytosis, so Im very cautious about mine too. I had really bad symptoms once I was off the immune suppressants. Like everything became enhanced? Does that sound similar to you? 
This happened to a friend of minea son. He went psychotic on adhd meds. The doctors didnt recognize it as a side effect and wanted to add Risperdal. He called me and I told him to stop it all and wait a few weeks. Within a month hes not psychotic and undiagnosed with autism.
Im so sorry; I have an undiagnosed autoimmune condition and its horrible. I hope the steroids help; they help me but Im still bedridden. Sending lots of love your way!

excuse me annika have u ever heard of undiagnosed ADHD and how going through adolescence without treating it can worsen a person's executive dysfunction GREATLY

Your so amazing for what your doing! I could also truly use help. I lost my job from covid and health issues, i was diagnosed last month with Epilepsy and Lupus and prior having chiari brain malformation with 2 brain surgeries, fibromyalgia and mother of 4. Thank you  God Bless
The host has CFS/ME as well as an undiagnosed heart condition that causes her to pass out and have extreme chest pains. One of our alters has bipolar disorder and a few have varying levels of anxiety and depression disorders!
i genuinely dont fucking feel smart in any sense whatsoever i am just really fucking good at bullshitting i have been depressed all my life and my brain is fucking mush because of it and i most likely have an undiagnosed (but-soon-to-be-diagnosed) developmental disorder
These two attitudes are exactly what kept my silly ass struggling with anxiety and depression due to undiagnosed ADHD and autism for 25 years. We really need to be better to ourselves out here.
My mum is autistic but she disagrees  says she 'just' has OCD: "I've done CBT  I'm not going through all that again!". She agrees that my Dad is undiagnosed autistic.
thinking about all the undiagnosed mental illnesses i probably have hm. dermatillomania if you're reading this fuck you
Worth looking at.  Tuberculosis is a serious issue, especially among illegal invaders and "migrants" of all sorts.  It also routinely does go undiagnosed until it hoses you.  And I've noted the odd "data disconnect" myself in a couple of podcasts.
What is it with Eastenders and extreme over reaction? Tommy is dyslexic and Jean looks like shes about to have a nervous breakdown over it. Remember how Linda basically became an alcoholic over Ollies undiagnosed autism? Im confusion here luv! #EastEnders

my rsd in high school was so awful. i still think about how i used to act emotionally and i hate myself. but i also was dealing with undiagnosed depression, anxiety, and adhd but luckily im somewhat getting better and more sensible about stuff but i still have trouble-

I had also planned to seek out a therapist before the world imploded, because I have deep suspicions that I have undiagnosed ADD. Which definitely didnt help with math either.
this caption myopia utopia is in several posts...his new post is a possible album look. hes been through a fashion and self journey..so maybe he was stuck in a dry idea period, feeling restricted and now hes living his best life hey guys mg1 is going to be SICK.
Hyperactivity is only a facet of ADHD (I dont like that they lumped them together) and says nothing of the chronic difficulty to concentrate.  That IS an issue and plagues adults who are undiagnosed.  A lot of those x works better with their hands people have ADHD.
Weirdly enough my mental health is pretty okay right now but my body is absolutely falling apart. Currently 3 undiagnosed issues and Im so frustrated and broke and I want to go to my doctor but Im in Newbridge 
Life has been tough for me lately. I try to hide it and not worry about my undiagnosed issues but being home and out of work lately has had a significant impact on my mental and physical health due to neurological issues. The bills wontCash app garretp88 #JeffreeStarApproved
My daughter has Chiari malformation. She's in several support groups for it. One of her friends from a group was hospitalized with COVID19  brain swelling about a month ago. What's interesting to me about what this article calls "stranger symptoms", they are all Chiari symptoms
Hi Ms.  Heart!  Sana mapili nyo din po ang baby ko.  He was diagnosed of Cerebral palsy,  microcephaly,  and generalized epilepsy.  2 yrs na po syang naka-NGT dahil hindi nya na kaya magswallow.  He badly needs medicine for his seizure maintenance. Pls... Ms. Heart.
So every stress related heart attack, every undiagnosed stage two cancer which is treated too late, every suicide due to loneliness, all the increased mental health problems and homes and jobs and livelihoods destroyed I can blame on you. Give your head a wobble...
Hope so.. A friend's kid has mastocytosis AND tuberous sclerosis, somehow. Known folks with all sorts of things that come with compromised or reduced immune systems, or have other issues. Tbh, it wouldn't even matter if I knew someone personally, I'd still be worried about that..
There was a huge split over this among all medics. Earlier lockdown would meanmore people getting ill and dying when lockdown ends as less of the population would be immune, more undiagnosed and untreated cancers, domestic violence, depression So it will even out.
is it executive dysfunction? is it adhd? who knows babey, undiagnosed has been the story of my life tbh
Some virologists say #coronavirus tends to exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions,  it seems this is exactly what's happening in my case with reawakening of my ME/CFIDS myalgia  now neuropathy. Or I'm experiencing severe Herxheimer reactions to the virus being mopped out.
I know I go on the same rant at least once a month but it really gets under my skin. Justin struggled for a year and a half because of an undiagnosed disease, gets a diagnosis, is brave enough to share it with millions of people then gets made fun of and bullied for having ticks

Of course Johnny had a major drug problem. was trying to get clean when he died. was off Heroin and on a methadone program. Probably died of undiagnosed leukemia 
i feel like i have undiagnosed adhd and ive been BEGGING to go and ser for weeks before quarantine started and my parents kept putting it off so now im just. wait ing
Typical LASIK outcome. Many side effects and poor vision. Gaslighting by the LASIK clinic, blaming patient. She would have appreciated her mild myopia after age 40, now she will have a lifetime of poor vision and problems. Avoid #LASIK. Please share!
I dont understand the myopia of these health officials. Dont you plan for more than one kind of health crisis? SARS and MERS should have taught them that. These people are asleep at the wheel and thousands of people have died because of it. They must be held to account.#COVID19
But even this feels like what falls under the undiagnosed category. A lot of our parents dealt with mental health issues in their kids with ifoti and holy water. Psychopath or not that can build a lot of resentment and cause a child to act out.
... youngest graduates, but I dont know if I can. My newest illness that started 16 months ago is STILL undiagnosed and is the worst one with tremors and seizures. I cant drive and sometimes I talk like a 4yo. I cant imagine anyone would hire that. My husband works from...
I'm also ADHD and dyslexic - which was all undiagnosed in school - so no, my time at school wasn't very productive. But I finished, passed all my subjects and am now a masters student. So fuck you.
I understand your frustration. I was diagnosed with MS, then undiagnosed, then told it was possibly a clinically isolated event. After 5 doctors, I gave up.
Porphyria Awareness Week is April 18-25th. Know the signs and symptoms. This rare genetic disorder is incurable and quite deadly if undiagnosed. I know, I have this rare disease.
A girl I worked with had similar symptoms and myalgia with a low temp and was admitted to hospital after being misdiagnosed and was finally diagnosed with covid19, she is now on the mend.
How Covid19 effects the brain? It causes dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease stroke, ataxia, seizure, taste-smell-vision impairment, nerve pain  skeletal muscular injury. Just sharing med info on temporary basis.
They have overlapping symptoms. Fever, GBW, headache, myalgia etc. There has been scenarios where someone who tests positive on Malaria RDT also tests positive on COVID19 RDT. Such cross reaction is causing some panic in hospitals. COVID PCR is coming out negative on such cases.
P.S. My blood pressure was getting high as I got to my sickest point with undiagnosed folate,  deficiencies among others. The INSTANT I started to take  the metabolic block it normalised as did my ESR. Its too bad doctors are so stupid this has been
You dont have to lie to me about Plaquenil. Ive taken it. I had ataxia, memory loss  falling down stairs  into walls from the ataxia. Despite decreasing the dose by 1/2, I still had those symptoms. So, you can just go lie to ppl who want to be lied to.
Theres a developing tsunami of unmet need  harm caused by undiagnosed serious disease  eg cancer. We will regret every day we havent  designated safe (as Covid free as possible) regional diagnostic and treatment hospitals in Wales

Between that, the actual damage I suffered to my body (undiagnosed sleep apnea=body doesnt heal at night), a full loss of faith in humanity by some of the rudest customers (Ive worked 8 yrs  service) Ive ever encountered, I do not look at my time there fondly.
You ready for 24 years of dead dad, abusive mom, undiagnosed asd (12 years), mom in denial, perfectionist mom, a lot of mom issues, stress eyebrow plucking, fianc saying I have more baggage than he thought and he doesn't know if he can handle it and mentioning breaking up?
1/2 Im a RT in sleep medicine...we get the opposite. I catch undiagnosed heart blocks, afib, pvcs, pacs and other things all the time. Its scary. Sometimes theyre on a cpap and have a pacemaker w untreated afib and its waking them up(unbeknownst to them) when theyre getting
This scares me that more Kawasaki cases could be triggered by coronavirus.  My sister died partly due to underlying undiagnosed Kawasaki (not full reason) at 37 so please get checked if your child poorly asap! #kawasakidisease #itvthismorning 
I learned late last year that I'm probably bi-polar not just depressed. Then at the start of this year I also learned I'm probably undiagnosed autistic and ADD/ADHD either as well as or instead of everything else. It's been a confusing few months lol.
It comes in waves  as you pass through stages of life. Mine went ghost once my parents divorced (alcoholic womanizing w/ I think undiagnosed depression didn't help). I was 11. I ***HATE*** being ghosted (happening right now w/ who I consider a dear friend). Perfectionism at bay.

realising I have (probably) got undiagnosed ADHD... explains so much of my life and why I struggled.
My GP here in Germany told me MS often stays undiagnosed for years, and he said one reason is that is affects predominantly women between 20 and 30, and if they go to a doctor with the typically diffuse early MS symptoms, no one takes them seriously.
Last week alone, 4 people asked me for natural ways they could treat and cure myopia. One of them was so concerned because her vision had worsened over the years.
I had a pituitary rumor and had surgery back in 2012 for it, but I still have a piece left which is why I still get my migraines.  last yr I got a new diagnosis of Chiari malformation. Basically my brain is literally falling out  so when the pain comes, I smoke lol
#TimsTwitterListeningParty I have epilepsy, at the point when i first saw Pi it was undiagnosed. It was devastatingly relatable - the shakes, time/memory loss, migraines, confusion, hallucinations, right down to some of the sound. Bang on. Did you look into it?
For those who think they got it bad you could be like this patient I am caring for whos been crying all day cause he knows his Huntingtons chorea is worsening by the day and his family want nothing to do with him cause the disease is a literal death sentence, pray for peace plz
Im still hearing this from even chiari arachnoid and EDS patients when it could be dangerous- my nsg said NO!
I spent 25 years being undiagnosed with severe anxiety. Being diagnosed last year brought alot into perspective. This comic hits real cause I never understood why I was feeling the way I did and would burn out trying to fight it and end up in a worst state

Sir, you are suffering from microcephaly and severe case of communiviridae. Go read again the cited paper and come with another one. Because this has nothing to do with Hindu and slims. One more thing, your small brain wrote "not common" what is just opposite this article says.
Has anyone else been feeling not only mentally much worse during the covid19 outbreak, but physically much worse than usual as well?  The way mental health affects physical health is so wild. Either that, or we all have undiagnosed/uncommon presentations of covid19 lol.
Definitely #dementia and he probably has undiagnosed or refuse to treat mental health issues. It will get worse. Why is this not addressed? This is a big part of the story. #GOP enablers are complicit with ignoring his declining cognitive abilities that threaten our Nation.
He is so psychologically disturbed. Its surreal to me that no profs/psychs are analyzing this behavior. In addition to extreme signs of narcissistic personality disorder, he also appears undiagnosed bipolar. It is so hard to watch theres no way to not cringe
Pretty sure said cousin has several undiagnosed/untreated mental illnesses. Had suspected bipolar disorder for awhile.
( I grew up with an undiagnosed  inflammatory illness. It was taken for psychological "weakness" - psychosomatic.)

My daughters neurosurgeon told us that they believe 1 in 50 has Chiari yet, of course, most are asymptomatic. PPl who develop symptoms later in life - there's typically a trigger of some sort. My daughter's pediatrician thought her trigger was Lyme. Maybe the virus is a trigger?
Allen was diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathy after 15 years of diabetes undiagnosed. He said it almost immobilized him. After treatment, Allen said, he finally got to where he could walk, but instead he ran back that day. #diabetestreatment
Menieres, Chronic Migraine, Hemiplegic Migraine, chronic back pain (from a fusion L5-S1). Although if I'm honest I think many of my symptoms can be attributed to undiagnosed MS.
That Busby character really got some undiagnosed mental illness. Wasn't he commenting on Mark's IG live ft Drake at 5 AM in the morning the other day.
My trauma is due to being undiagnosed and therefore treated as less than my whole life. Now I am angry and bitter. Also frequently unable to mask or function well. COVID is going to send me into burnout.
Damn my last retweet got me fucking crying I've always wanted to hear my parents say they're proud of me. They don't know the full extent of what I do. Just that I travel  teach classes. Even when I was going to school for Neuromuscular therapy they doubted my choice

that's cool but there are a shitload of adults w/ undiagnosed eating disorders who think theyre "just being difficult" and constantly hearing ppl say stuff like "picky eaters are childish" tends to further ostracize them and worsen their symptoms :)
Like you said how many people yearly checkups are being postponed? How many could have been diagnosed with cancer then but it's just growing worse right now? Or may have been diagnosed with something else that is going undiagnosed longer now?

I have been dealing with an undiagnosed movement disorder and had an appointment with a dismissive neurologist who thinks my problems may be "all in my head" yesterday. She referred me to a hypnotist. The hypnotist in question? A fucking rapist!

Justine sentenced the killer before he had the facts! Did he ,the killer, have a brain tumor  A COVID-19 breakdown?  Maybe an undiagnosed ailment? Or is Justine saying that all mentality ill people are killers.
If I look at my mom an undiagnosed bipolar its a miracle she was inundated to a cult, cuz had my mom not had a religious structure to guide her parenting it probably would have been way crazier, abusive, and drug and alcohol filled.
Same. I hated Anzac Day as a child. There was always drunkenness, arguments, violence. Ive never celebrated it. Looking back Im sure my father suffered from undiagnosed PTSD but of course, we knew nothing of that at the time.
If my undiagnosed chest pains kill me because Corona cancelled my appointment with a respiratory specialist, that would be quite ironic
Are you (or the medical community) following COVID19 and thrombosis? It seems there is a lot happening there... I, myself, suffered from a thrombophlebitis that apparently came from nowhere...

Oh my gosh! When I was in med school 20 yrs ago we had an elderly patient with undiagnosed breast cancer that had eaten away the entire breast.   I remember I blamed her for not seeking medical care.   Now I have MBC and know how often patients get blamed for their cancers.
sadly true .His cavalier complacent attitude has compounded UK public health also-after this is over NHS will be overwhelmed all over again catching up with undiagnosed untreated life threatening cancers,heart disease etc.NHS has been run in to ground for at least 10 years
35 years, 1st 7 undiagnosed. Disabled now. Last 17 years 24/7/365 pain. Have to fight for even inadequate treatment. Lyme issues shunted aside after 9/11, after 2008 meltdown, now again back burnered due to covid-19. Frustrated  angry as hell!
talk to your doctor if you think killing rich people is immoral and totalitarian but cant give a solid answer on if its immoral to kill millions more poor people, you may have undiagnosed bootlicker syndrome
Stereotypes so people go undiagnosed maybe for their entire life. Organisations like autism speaks that pretend they're a charity but spread false information and use scare tactics, even now with their new flowery wording.
I am constantly amazed at the amount of people who are Meth addicts who commit crimes and then all of a sudden a medical person claims they have an undiagnosed mental health condition. The use of Meth CAUSES MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. Its a pissweak bullshit excuse.
People without Covid who have ill health are afraid to visit GP's. Cancer going undiagnosed. Elective ops cancelled = Anxiety, depression, fear. Abuse, anger, violence, su*cide - all increasing as we focus on Wuhan Flu.
What a prick! All the work thats put into infection control. He could be undiagnosed and infect people. The hospital boss should have said no to his visit.  Appalling behaviour. What an embarrassment to the Government and the USA. 
Its in my neurological system which scares me. I have no taste/smell, eye pain  blurring (which has  the most severe myalgia that I have ever had. Luckily-it hasnt disrupted my cognition. But yes,I do believe it causes brain damage- I suspect that happened to my Dad
lmao imagine being fat shamed by your own mother and her not recognizing all the accomplishments that youve had since you were like 5, her letting your sisters autism still to this day go undiagnosed because shes embarrassed and her not recognizing she has serious issues. lol
Symptoms overlap of pyrexia, myalgia and malaise can scare away ill-prepared hcws, reduce access for patients as resources are shunted to c19, and where diagnostic test coverage for both is poor, can brew a public health dual-cocktail of disaster.
And the idea that I have mild autism because I am hyperlexic and online active makes me MAD, tbh. 
Alone these behaviours are meaningless and can point in multiple directions. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 14 and that diagnosis masked my ADHD for fifteen years. People on social media describing their lived experience of ADHD - their footprints, their patterns

Haha! I must have some form of undiagnosed OCD ADD which means if I start decorating then it's an agony of edges and touching up - Missus - to get the bloody job as good as I can. This room began with going through all my tat - always a bad sign - and has ended with a bad back!
I have a patient at the moment who following a recent left hemipontine infarct presents with severe dysarthria. He is very hypernasal. Could any lovely SLTs out there offer advice on working with this? Feel free to retweet as Im not big on twitter so have limited followers!
People claim that since the Coronavirus kills old people and people with pre-existing conditions then lockdown should be lifted. But some of those actually have an undiagnosed pre-existing condition they dont know about, it would be bad for some to find out after. 
Another friend diagnosed with #ADHD today. Something I've been reminded of: if you think you have ADHD and look up the symptoms, don't just reflect on how often you exhibit the behaviours. Also reflect on how much energy it takes you to NOT exhibit them. It shouldn't be so hard.
Emma. I feel badly for playing with you earlier, you obviously have some undiagnosed mental health issues. I can get you some contact details for local counselling services if you want to DM me with the area you're in. 
Can we talk about the curse of being a "gifted" kid while having undiagnosed ADHD? Has anyone else survived this specially crafted hell?
Many are claiming they are suddenly mentally ill, with a previously undiagnosed psychiatric condition, which renders them incapable of staying in and helping to save lives.
the fact that so many women go through life with undiagnosed mental illnesses because the only studies done to diagnose certain illnesses have only been done on men thus leaving room for different unknown symptoms in women to go unnoticed makes me want to die.
You have people with heart disease, copd, all these serious diseases, who are now undiagnosed, untreated, and increasingly getting worse without maybe even knowing until its too late.
Take home message: if someone is diagnosed with anorexia, check if autism has gone undiagnosed. Not all those with anorexia have underlying autism but a significant minority do. Misdiagnosis or under-diagnosis can mean missing out on the right support 
Clinically obese but accepted as normal nowadays. And undiagnosed conditions! When announced I think metabolically compromised in some way. Hope to see the stats in the future sad as they are. Must drive health policies around the world.
I wonder if OP's brother could have an undiagnosed  sensory disorder that makes it physically hurt to wear headphones? Because he keeps refusing to wear them and even gave them away. 
There's a gulf between this meme or whatever it is and people who were placed in those programs ostensibly to help them but it contributed to their undiagnosed autism and/or ADHD and not getting the supports they really needed. It's complex, which includes positive experiences.
4 weeks trying to get GP home visit, leading to ambulance call  took to  , our mum was discharged 2hrs later, told trouble eating, breathing  swallowing was anxiety, she died 2wks later with undiagnosed throat cancer. Even when you try to get help the focus is not there.
They started drugging my poor grandma in the 50s. She had undiagnosed akathisia the entire time I knew her, and ended up developing dementia.
Funny how all these grubs have long term undiagnosed mental issues as soon as they commit a crime. Give me a spell.
I was being bullied bc of my weight and everything else (turns out I had undiagnosed adhd which has emotionally growth problems) and I wasnt happy with myself and the world around me so anything that brought me any joy (one direction) felt like I was betraying how sad I was
I watched the flaccid dysarthria video- it was confusing and hard to follow at first. It was sad to hear him say I can think about what I want to say, but I cant say it #csd1080go

So my brother may be an undiagnosed bipolar thats convinced Im a drug addict simply because He watched a YouTube video, baked out of his mind, about someone who misused the drug and got addicted to it... he really thinks I only use it to stay awake all hours of the day
YO after a bad flare up, I had lasting nystagmus and diplopia and I was too afraid to tell my employer how bad it actually was bc there was no visible proof. I COULDNT EVEN SEE THE PATIENTS I WAS TRYING TO HELP.
Also, and we can't forget this, there are countless illnesses going undiagnosed, including mental health disorders throughout this pandemic. A PLAN to get back to some normality is probably a very important lifeline for some finding this period particularly difficult. 2/2
(also I feel that, undiagnosed adhd made me cope unkindly to myself too)
ove been thinking alot abt this lately but im convinced i have undiagnosed adhd and it wasnt obvious bc ive always been able to save myself and have good grades in general but on the other hand id almost fail the classes i found boring sjbskd
Have had an undiagnosed circadian rhythm disorder where I sometimes dont sleep for days, or natural sleep schedule reverts to insomnia and even I am struggling worse than usual yet nothing about my life really changed. Everyone getting bad sleep is valid.

Yep! I was reading some of her replies and she sounds awful. Shes claiming the 11 y/o pushes family away with his behavior. BUT HES A CHILD. And she is trying to pull the whole disability card saying hes undiagnosed. Shes going to be a terrible step-mom. Im angry for this kid

My sister had a similar experience being undiagnosed as dyslexic at high school - accused of being lazy because they refused to believe smart kids could be dyslexic. Finally got support at uni and came out with a First in biomedical sciences
As for the PTSD, I'm already in over my head(C-PTSD since childhood, undiagnosed until last year), but that's exactly why I'm doing this.  
a lot of yall are undiagnosed sociopaths that change your personalities like clothing and need shock therapy
I'm kind of in the same boat myself man. (I have an as yet undiagnosed bone disorder. Lots of surgeries in the last 9 yrs). So we just decided it's better to take our health safety into our own hands ya know?
when I feel sad I remind myself that I wasnt skinnier in high school I just had mono and an undiagnosed thyroid problem
I have asthma, on top of my type of elhers-danlos, which allows my neuromuscular condition to subluxate ALL my joints - including spine  ribs!  jaw - with painful muscle cramps, that often make it difficult to breath. F'em all  give us universal healthcare yesterday!
I think it's not just about deradicalizing. Men often go undiagnosed for mental illnesses because they 1) don't goto doctors as much 2) are too proud to see mental health workers and 3) don't or can't express their feelings like women. This allows their illness to escalate fast.
My mom is claustrophobic  Im pretty in the early stages of dementia. Shes also always been selfish. My father has been doing whatever she wants for so long I dont think hes capable of standing up to her. 
I was gonna ask if my information gap is from having undiagnosed ADHD until 17 when I saw my first psychiatrist or from going to a poor school...but I was too busy not paying attention in my classes to notice if the course was lacking
Mine was my 8th grade math teacher. Used to have panic attacks because I couldnt grasp math well and she spent so much time on me. Turns out I think I just have undiagnosed dyscalculia lmao
I think the main takeaway here isnt a criticism of DBZ as much as it is acknowledgment that my 18 YO undiagnosed ADHD brain had a really hard time Waiting For Goku 
I had the same in mid-Feb after a trip to Vegas. RIDT positive for Flu A, but this was far worse than any flu I ever had. Fever, painful dry cough, myalgia w/ persisting lung soreness and dyspnea for weeks. I wonder about coinfection or previously unknown crossreactivity of RIDT.
A lifetime around people with undiagnosed mental illness, horrific coping mechanisms, and substance dependency has taught me that few of us went into the *global pandemic* "okay" and none of us are coming out of this *almost universally traumatizing event* unscathed

That's the right thing to do, it sounds like hes got dementia. My dad had in undiagnosed for about a year. Vascular dementia he was in and out a lot and very aggressive.
This is unbelievably stupid. The real issue is why is there so much undiagnosed cases of high blood pressure and diabetes amongst communities of color? The coronavirus does not see color but the underlying health issues is what needs to be addressed.
I swear many of them have undiagnosed (or maybe just untreated) psychiatric disorders.  That level of paranoia is, whewwww.
RT And how many will die because of undiagnosed cancer, suicide, overdoses etc all caused by the lockdown?
Did policymakers overlook large number of undiagnosed coronavirus patients?  Would have brought the death rate projections way down.  But CDC wasted a month with their faulty tests.  But you know... THEY are the "experts" we all relied on.  
If you knew the history of the neurodiversity movement as well as the history of the medical/psychiatric establishment's treatment of us, then you'd know that most autistic people are probably undiagnosed.
He suffers from another undiagnosed disease; SFBS. The medical term is Shit For Brains Syndrome. Affects many in the Liberal Media.
KZN Health MEC, please reconsider strategy. COVID-19 likely largely spread by asymptomatic or undiagnosed people, not diagnosed people. Draconian quarantine could discourage testing, driving disease underground.
this is what undiagnosed type 1 diabetes looks like. I had no idea I was diabetic and waited too long to see a doctor. dont be like me here are the warning signs that I stupidly ignored
#JeffreeStarApproved Hey Jeffree!!! I could really use your help I'm caring for my 2 grandbabies and my daughter due to my her falling ill 2yrs ago at age 22 it has taken them till this Feb to diagnose her w/Spinocerebellar Ataxia a very rare disease Please  Thank U

Lets not dwell on that.. This child prolly has undiagnosed dyslexia, conduct disorder, ADHD  or some other psychiatric condition. Plus, I understand the father.. hes frustrated and you cant blame him either
My moms nursing home has had countless deaths ALL with COVID19 symptoms, undiagnosed, yet the staff who brought it in, got diagnosed. The *marginalized* people such as these residents werent being tested as NOT Enough Tests.
15 miNs but they don't know anything about my conditions. They didn't even do an MRI on me after my car accident even though me  my mom were telling them I have chiari  I was being tested for EDS but my Drs knew for sure I have a Connective Tissue Disorder. They missed my TBI.
Ppl are gonna b afraid of me for a loooong time. I have a chronic cough for almost 10 yrs due to neuromuscular problems.
Undiagnosed. So essentially he has only had so called Mental Health issues since he has been arrested. How can these lawyers sleep at night. Nobody takes responsibility for their actions anymore. Pathetic.
Bro people go hella long periods for ANYTHING undiagnosed which is why we have check ups  etc  the virus has an incubation period similar to how you get someone prego but the baby takes time same for the virus it takes time to grow  then shows which is why you ignorant
Yes to tinnitus, also major issues with my sinuses. Not sure if related to intercranial pressure as we can have Chiari malformations or spontaneous CFS leaks, or if it's connected to the dysautonomia. Or MCAD which is also a common comorbidity

Kinda sucks having a med. issue undiagnosed after 10 tests.. and youre p sure you know what it is, but nobody wants to test for it (hm try this pill, wait and see for years), and it only gets worse... and then pandemic happens so you gotta cancel your last straw follow-up..
its a shame that many also stem from undiagnosed #mentalHealth issues for years
damn your teachers actually care about that?? i spent my whole school career with obvious and undiagnosed mental illness but those bitches gave me nothing
Serious question because you seem panicked. The shutdown was supposed to ensure hospitals weren't overwhelmed and we had all the PPE necessary and now, many are now empty or laying off employees. How many cancers will go undiagnosed because they couldn't get testing?
Back a little over a year ago, my sister was so sick  in pain (had undiagnosed cancer) - I took her to the ER - they would have admitted her but had NO BEDS there or any hospitals in other nearby towns including Bangor. They cannot handle a big outbreak here.
He passed away at 4am. The cause of death was Coronavirus but the medical team that looked out for him believe it almost certain he had an undiagnosed underlying health condition. But now theres no way of knowing for sure.
Chances are this lockdown is bringing a lot of undiagnosed OCD disorders out and making people go a little wild with the Howard Hughes side of it only without the genius.
...Is THIS why my family bickered on a near-constant basis? (Dad and brother were both diagnosed, mom undiagnosed, I just got my diagnosis this month )
Id bet money thats why i have memory issues and persistent ataxia because i never had those issues before that happened. Imagine if he had just listened to me instead of shaming me lol
Earlier, spoke with us about the intersection between climate justice and disability justice. With a multitude of undiagnosed yet painful symptoms for a decade, Laura went about life with chronic pain, unable to walk, and sometimes with the wrong prescription. 1/?

But the major issue is that with capped testing, we can't really know how many are infected. And with the policy to triage the presumed-infected elderly to stay out of hospitals and die undiagnosed at home, hospitalization/IC and death rates are also badly incomplete.
'Many media reports of young and healthy people dying from Covid19 have proven to be false upon closer inspection. Many of these people either did not die from Covid19 or they in fact had serious preconditions (such as undiagnosed leukaemia).'

African parents are very abusive  they are poor communicators when it comes to expressing their displeasure. Many Africans, unknown to them, developed undiagnosed mental health problems because of the plethora of verbal, physical  emotional absuses they were exposed to at home.

How many of us had issues with our sight but our parents didnt find out until much later because they were too busy beating us for being slow that they didnt realize that we just needed to see an eye doctor?
looking back, looking at the things i saw ages 12-18, all with undiagnosed mental illness and unmedicated psychotic features, surrounded by adults and peers who insisted it was no big deal viewing this content?? like it's insane to me how dissociated i was from my own emotions
So the lockdown has definitely had its place. But it is beginning to look like the cure will be worse than the problem. Increased suicides, undiagnosed health issues due to hospitals stopping all elective procedures. Its just a mess.

I'm torn. I think it was an overreach. But the mental health rules are there for a reason. Then again, guys tend to not seek help, so there are guys who make it in and don't get screened out because they are undiagnosed. But her reasoning makes her sound like a concern troll.

Some kids have undiagnosed learning disability, but instead of finding the sympathy and support they desire from their parents, they are persistently abused and humiliated for being dumb. How then can you fix a deficiency thats genetic? How do you teach an elephant to fly?

When Chihiro went to the vet with undiagnosed kidney failure, the next day they called and said she had eaten. I cried. And all I could think of was this scene. And what was at stake for her and my family. Hits home.
I felt some parallels with her experiences just not her stardom, obviously. I wonder beyond the one or so articles I have found, just how many diagnosed and better yet undiagnosed autistic women had/have alcohol problems. It's the social lubricant and anxiety med of choice sadly.
Very sad she died of an undiagnosed brain aneurysm in 04.
Stupid. Pathologic liar. Jealous of Obama. Hates his wife. Thought he'd be king. Corrupt. Will be indicted. Destroys anyone he touches. Incompetent. Psychopath. Undiagnosed and untreated autism.
This cat isn't with us anymore (passed away due to undiagnosed diabetes), but we had a boy cat who peed on everything. Including my pillow, my bed, my bedframe, my dresser...we threw a LOT of stuff away due to urine.

Their publishing and your focus on Infection Fatality Rate is the least convincing part of their (your argument).  They relied on confirmed deaths, which is useless, especially as we know SC County had (probably more than a few) early undiagnosed deaths.

My Senior Film, "Me, Myself, and I" is a semi-abstracted experience about what life with DID is like when you're undiagnosed w/ trauma and you have no idea what's going on.
Thanks for stopping routine health tests! Guess Ive just got to wait out COVID til I can get a smear. Letting potentially thousands of people go undiagnosed, and what others have you paused? Trading one life for another. Disgusting. #UKlockdown
Friends and family have had to postpone doctor appointments. I worry that even skipping routine or followup appointments will cause some people to have issues undiagnosed or untreated til they become a bigger problem.
There should be critique but these are sick with undiagnosed disease!

Me and my family think I have undiagnosed ADHD
Im a reading specialist and think thats why he was booted out of his private school and sent to military academy. Believed himself to be dumb and would act out and act up to hide his shame. Shame is a huge throughline. Still see this response in too many undiagnosed kids.
Savita died of undiagnosed e. coli which led to sepsis, neither of which are cured by abortion. She has been exploited by pro-choice lobbyists ever since. I'd have to look up your other examples.
My whole life is basically one single of undiagnosed autism. Fighting with teachers over not being able to sit still, constantly breaking things or accidentally injuring myself, failing to understand other humans, losing friends that thought I didn't value them...
Many have noted why exercise is harmful for people with ME, so I will mention a few other example. Exercise degranulates mast cells and can cause severe episodes in people with MCAS or mastocytosis.

The very dangerous thing is, we got in the way of the virus, now, when people come out again, the virus will start to spread again, not only do you have a virus, you know have all those cancer patients who went undiagnosed during this lockdown up to 25000 of them.

The first ppl theyre sending back to work? The poorest. Poor ppl dont have access to health care generally. Poor ppl often have undiagnosed conditions bc of this. They arent supplying us poor folk with protection (masks, gloves). What else is this but state sanctioned murder?

Agreed. But when is the last time we had millions of measles cases, most undiagnosed  have asymptomatic? I'm not against contact tracing; we'll need it. But a) it will be hard in this context  b) I don't see how it can be a panacea.
I was afraid of almost literally everything as a child with undiagnosed anxiety disorder.
Way to deflect from your kinky dreams. "An autopsy revealed that Klausutis had an undiagnosed heart condition and a coroner concluded she passed out and hit her head as she fell. The coroner said the head injury caused the death, but she wasnt struck by another person." Wompwomp
I was, and still am but I'm sure, undiagnosed autistic as a kid and was always bullied and teased at school and treated like I was stupid at home. (nothing on what I know you've dealt with but still) so anime where the unassuming or underestimated guy is the hero appeals 2 me.
People can't appreciate how hard we try to understand social stuff because they are clueless about what we're going through. It's just sad. And I grew up undiagnosed, not knowing what was wrong with me, and personalizing it, hating myself. At least that part is over.
omg skskshsjsks nah i thought i just had an undiagnosed case of dyslexia

This is what my friend in the breast cancer clinic said. She was afraid that new, undiagnosed cases were not being identified and that cases such as your sister were not receiving necessary treatment. The "lock it down tight" people need to think of unintended consequences.

The EAC should have made a concerted effort and acted in unison otherwise some states are going to keep us all under lockdown as they continue incubating C19. Some of our leaders continue dooming the continent with their myopia.

I'll risk going to the hospital. At least the nurses will have something to do besides dance. Someone should do a case study on the effects of the shutdown on diabetes and heart disease. Not to mention all the undiagnosed cancers festering in people right now.
I was never allowed a Mr Munchy. I was stuck with either the white or pink Bunny for tiny me had undiagnosed ADHD and chocolate made me a crazy person until I was about 9.
YES! it's a whole ordeal to manage/cope, and worse when you don't have a name for whatever the hell it is. i'm so sorry yours went undiagnosed for so long, but glad you got the info you needed.
Well fingers crossed it does ease by then! If not you need more advice. I had muscle spasm in my ribs years ago which was an undiagnosed chest infection, so you need to be careful. Take care of yourself! 
They are unfortunate by-product of erring on the side of over preparation. Hospitals are now furloughing staff. Cancer diagnoses are way down putting unwitting undiagnosed cancer pts serious risk.
With hospitals and clinics furloughing or laying off staff not directly involved in treating coronavirus, how many breast cancers will go undiagnosed because patients either cant get an appointment or are too scared to go? How many prostate cancers? Malignant melanomas?
I miss my granny who died..dementia of course 25 years ago..the doctor never gave a shit...undiagnosed dementia..

Ive no idea, though most likely influenza or an undiagnosed leukaemia or immune suppression. Some medics speculate does not even fully infect youngsters, possibly because they dont express ACE2, a receptor Covid19 uses to gain entry.

On top of that, the clothes in my closet were never arranged. Like we tried. I legit tried so hard to keep my surroundings clean as a kid and it was just a big no. A lot of people, including my parents, thought it was just me being kalat but it really was just undiagnosed adhd

Compound to the problem the vast undiagnosed sleep apnea people that are out there along with non compliance, makes for a perfect storm of accelerating the mortality due to hypoxemia.
People will die if it's lifted or if it's not.  What's disgusting and abominable is Pritzker and ignoring the lives lost from suicide, undiagnosed illnesses, economic collapse, child abuse, domestic abuse, drug addiction, etc.
It's hard to talk about my life lately without sounding like "I have glass bones and paper skin." Between my years of having panic attacks in any large room or big city or outside open space, years of literal starvation due to undiagnosed and untreated stomach issues (1/5)

Am tentatively undiagnosed with pneumonia and it might be bronchitis?? I'm honestly so confused. I'll see a new dr in the morning.

Our school is trying to come up with a solution. We'll be ok. But I worry about parents who have a harder time advocating for their children with sensory processing differences. And there are a lot of undiagnosed students with this disorder.
You REALLY know? An autopsy may show an undiagnosed, devastating disease/disorder that hadnt presented itself. NOT discounting the pain of the death. HE should be reason we seek what we dont know, how someone with no underlying medical issues dies from/with Covid-19

There will be thousands of ppl dying from illnesses and diseases that went undiagnosed (heart disease, cancer, organ diseases, etc) and untreated during the quarantine. We can only pray that the death toll isnt as high as the COVID 19 toll.
I just read an article about her assault case. Seems to me he has an undiagnosed mental health issue.

I guess my point is people are going to die no matter what we do. If not the virus than others will die of undiagnosed cancer and heart disease that could be treated. Or all the abuse in homes right now that services cant manage. Even child poisoning is up.

They can find cure for coronavirus but can't find wat causes or permanent undiagnosed for endometriosis, alot of women out there probably have it n don't even know they have Pls can something be done about it I think ima do a campaign about endometriosis 
I know no one will see this but I need to say it to the world my 27 year old son died on Thursday from am undiagnosed heart condition. I am so shattered I cant breathe. I ask for prayers of strength. Hug your loved ones tight.
cant stop thinking about how many people with cancer will go undiagnosed because theyll think their symptoms arent serious enough to go to the doctors and taking up their time during this pandemic, pls youre still valid
Mental illness.  Thats what it is.  Theres a lot of undiagnosed, untreated mental illness out there  hes this king of the mentally ill.  He thinks, talks, tantrums, is narcissistic  selfish... just like them.
Some minor respiratory ailment- undiagnosed. Covid negative but the tests are so terrible, it's almost useless. Actually feeling better but also more alarmed with each passing day. Keeping well hydrated, fed,  medicated. Vitals are good (36.9C, 98% SpO2), not much else to say
Barely closed! -weve been shut in for 5weeks. We will now see the real problems of economic disaster, massive unemployment, deaths from normal diseases that are going untreated  undiagnosed  huge mental health issues especially of our kids whose futures are being destroyed!
25-50% of these people are asymptomatic and may be contagious. They don't look otherwise particularly young or fit. Throw in undiagnosed diabetes and heart disease. That is all.
My hot take is that Pippens migraine in 1990 was really an undiagnosed concussion from being repeatedly battered by Bill Laimbeer
I have GNE Myopathy, which is a different type of neuromuscular disease than DMD.  And yet, they are similar enough that watching this family deal with their child's prognosis reminded me of exactly what me and my parents went through during my diagnosis.
Me, is an absurd amount of time late to rehearsal due to my severe undiagnosed ocd
As someone who was the laughing baby (though I was actually 3 because I went undiagnosed for so long), I don't like my deafness being shown to the world for other people to derive joy. It symbolises their sad future of inaccessibility, ignorance and forced language deprivation
no im actually serious, i really think i am undiagnosed autist with an undisclosed deteriorated neuron structure
Many girls  women with #ADHD could be missing out on treatment because they're undiagnosed, reports. While boys with ADHD are often restless  impulsive, girls may be "introverted, dreamier and distracted."
What a load of shit. Having a mental illness doesn't mean you can't drive a heavy vehicle, even if it's diagnosed. Not to mention if it's undiagnosed it means no one even knows about it! Not defending this guy, but the general attitudes towards those with mental illness are shit.
Agreed. Its a long road of pain before Election Day. Political research has showed ppl dont remember how they felt or why past max. 6 mo. Its called myopia just like with eyesight. For low engagement voters they might not even remember what is going on right now by then. 
#LymeDisease destroys whatever organ or system it gets to  eventually the immune system. U stop producing antibodies so the 71%-fail-rate #lyme test wont work. #CDC based all stats in  everything theyve told doctors- while ensuring MILLIONS go undiagnosed, very ill, at risk
Waiting on cancer follow up to check Im still ok. Last week  neighbour died of sepsis which was left undiagnosed bc of no follow ups after a bike accident months ago. He was 27 with two kids. Its been a hideous time. We raised money for neighbour but really...enough.
45. Most disease is anthropic in origin. Myopia, sleep apnea, obesity, ugly people, adhd, depression, anxiety - all accidental syndromes produced in the pursuit of modernity. This is not a new trend. Disease itself is the product of sedentary agriculture. This is where man fell.
When I was a little girl, I thought I was pregnant! It was the only thing my mind could relate to feeling and hearing pulse in my belly because I was little when my Mom was pregnant with both brothers. I now know its related to arrhythmia, tremors and spasms but undiagnosed still
I didn't find out that I have auto-immune disease until I was in my 70s, undiagnosed conditions are often found at the death of  healthy youth frequent enough.  Social distance should have been sufficient, lock down very radical/freedom robbing.
think of the number of people with undiagnosed IR/T2D that might also be getting undiagnosed ketoacidosis as a result of COVID.  Potentially very serious.
Gios mental health is like very up and down because he is VERY depressed and has a lot of undiagnosed issues but hes also so determined to give Mimi a good life that he refuses to let that bleed into places where she can see it cus he wants her to have a normal life
3/3 had a brain scan MRI w/ cine flow done, I'd encourage U 2 get 1. EDS RARELY shows up ALONE. It can accompany  exacerbate chiari malformation, mast cell activation syndrome,  POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome).  sacral dimple pointing 2 tethered cord
the undiagnosed ADHD is causing problems for me still. i'm getting by. managing. 
its technically undiagnosed adhd but the reason I am sElF dIaGnOsiNg is bC almost every member of my family has it, its genetic lmao
they both look like they suffer from undiagnosed hyperthyroidism
Dementia isnt funny, but he is still undiagnosed. So unless we hear from a credible doctor, he might just be stupid.
Having known for yrs, she's probably gone undiagnosed for some mental disorder most likely split personality disorder if I would have to guess. Not a crime to have mental illness but certainly cannot have unstable politicians holding office. 
I read an autobiography of Erds titled The Man Who Loved Only Numbers. Im pretty sure he had undiagnosed ADHD because he took amphetamines in order to write papers with other mathematicians. Maybe a bit autistic, too. Fascinating culture of math geeks.
I have ADHD that went undiagnosed until I was an adult because of this. I was always in gifted classes, but that giftedness made the idea of a learning disorder fly out of the minds of those involved with my education. Now Im 22 and unmedicated bc its near impossible
Earlier this month my dad had to go the ER and I really appreciated the prayers and light. Right now, indications are that my mom might be fighting undiagnosed COVID-19 (3 weeks of cycling symptoms, including fevers, etc.).

Please pass this on to your team. Were already picking up pts who have been started on oral intake without specialist assessment  finding they have post-extubation dysphagia  dysphonia - we cant risk setting these pts back with aspiration pneumonia. They need #COVIDrehab
looking back at the stories and music i tried to write in high school and all i see is the undiagnosed adhd
Truck driver Mohinder Singh Bajwa has fronted court charged with the deaths of four police officers. His lawyer told the court he may have been suffering from an undiagnosed psychiatric illness his entire life and was in need of medical attention.
Oh, forgot to say I know it's much more difficult for single moms these days then when my son was little in the late 80s  early 90s. Sick before he was conceived, undiagnosed until he was 4. Can't imagine being that sick  struggling to survive in today's much meaner world.
I punched a hole in my wall when I was going through undiagnosed depression and didn't know how to communicate that hahaha
(turns out I was dealing with undiagnosed ADHD which didnt help.) He gave me leadership roles on the paper and allowed me to write about our mutual most important thing - music.  He actually had his own record label and I did some marketing for him one summer.
idk where youre at but here in America, not everybody has access to healthcare so things like thyroid issues can go undiagnosed. so someone could balloon up suddenly, work really hard to lose the weight their body WILL NOT shed, and then be attacked online for it
it would be a look at culpability, repression, undiagnosed mental illness, and the precarious emotional/financial state of people living under capitalism but im too depressed to write it rn
flip-flops since 2015.ecf renamed as ECPF (p for Prabhas who are unaware of it) .after Sarrainodu event u re-christened as ECBPF .slowly started Hating charan because of his inclination towards Kalyan then again Charan after Rangasthalam and now presently only  Bunny after Avpl
You minimize the parent. As a undiagnosed Dyslextic, my Mother taught me  What does not kill you....
Having nightmares about the spread of #Covid_19 in #Somali territories! With the pre-existing conditions of malnutrition  undiagnosed/untreated health diseases combined with lack of healthcare facilities n equipment! Its a death trap! #Covid_19Somaliland #Covid_19Somalia
Me : (probably bc undiagnosed) has an ED and depression, hate myself, my life and where I live, sleep 2 hours per night
Undiagnosed type 1 diabetes can can be life-threatening. Symptoms: frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue. These need immediate medical attention. #T1D #DKA
Your relentless claims that everything you don't like - or that shows how moronic you are - is a hoax, sounds just like the echolalia and palilalia my autistic son exhibits. However, he has a larger vocabulary and is more articulate than you are.
All my doctors are male because my two female doctors always overlooked my conditions as whiny or normal for my age and I went undiagnosed with a chronic illness for years. Lmaooo so no thanks, Ill stick to my male drs and gyno 
like... i am and will continue to seek diagnosis, but only because its a necessity under oppressive medical rule, and i resent having to. why cant my symptoms stand on their own?

The problem is they are not allowed to do normal medical care including elective procedures. These include joint replacements to colonoscopies. They need to be allowed to resume normal activities. How much life threatening disease is going undiagnosed. How much pain and suffering
Checked out but theres no place to request an autograph. I have the progressively fatal neuromuscular disease mitochondrial Myopathy  would LOVE  to get autographs from you  Amber please!  Thx so much!! #mito
NEW: Health Minister says about 35 people have died because their heart procedures were cancelled due to #COVID19. "I don't want to call them collateral damage, because they are deaths," she says.
A very few healthy or young people and for all we know they may have had undiagnosed problems too. There are also unconnected deaths which cloud the statistics. If the infection rate comes down, the virus- connected death rate will drop to 8-10 days later.

Hi! I lived with undiagnosed ADHD until I was 36, then I was diagnosed with cPTSD. What youre feeling now is a normal response to trauma! You need to rest. Really.

My room isnt this bad (mostly just clothes that never make it to a laundry basket and the rare cardboard box. But some peoples depression, anxiety, or undiagnosed adhd. Not saying it does, saying that it can. Also hoarding is real and true mental illness. 
Last one Ill mention is clear fanwar: OP says MY FAVE RULES YOUR FAVE SUCKS SAID WHAT I SAID and it kicks off. It can be based on myopia (knowing ONLY your fave) and trying to build an argument makes it messier, but its opinion vs. opinion, self vs. self. About fan, not fave.
Why left out the whole mass grave thing, the part where you go to the hospital with a broken leg and there is no one to treat you, but you bring the coronavirus home to your family and your wife dies because she had an undiagnosed heart condition that covid19 fixed forever.
Pretty sure I have undiagnosed PTSD... and its literally ruining my life and everything I love.
I ALSO have c-ptsd (undiagnosed, but I KNOW from my own research) and various other forms of mental illness/instability
It is hell, and like I said, our numbers arent accurate. We have many who are going undiagnosed. People are dying from it but arent counted as Covid victims.
Early manifestations are lethargy, hyporeflexia, followed by weakness, paralysis, hypotension, ECG changes (prolonged PR and QRS intervals), CNS depression, seizures, and RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION. In overdose, magnesium impairs neuromuscular transmission, manifested as weakness-
Im shocked and heartbroken. Im immunocompromised have an undiagnosed respiratory condition. Things dont look good If I catch Covid-19.
Very true.   Now the truck driver  as well as apparently having an undiagnosed physciatric condition, is saddened and depressed by what happened.  Wish he'd thought of that before sucking on his ice pipe.   It is sickening the way these pricks use mental illness to excuse actions

What happened to all the teens fucked up from vaping?? Is that still a thing? Or was it just undiagnosed covid???
I completely lost the lower register in my voice. And when I try to sing higher, its very weak and pitchy. Upside, theres an actual illness that describes what Im going through. Its called Muscle Tension Dysphonia. Downside, the cause of it is not because of physical
Omg. I think Im just coming to the realization, at age 29, that my persistent procrastination problem all throughout grade school and beyond was actually undiagnosed anxiety.
At some point the balance will change. We protect the Covid vulnerable by putting others in harms way. The longer the lockdown, the more undiagnosed cancers, DV murders, then deaths due to poverty and suicides. I would not want to be a politician right now. Damned either way.
Media reports of young and healthy people dying from Covid19 have proven to be false. Many of these people either did not die from COVID-19 or they in fact had serious preconditions (such as undiagnosed leukemia)

I bet so many mental illness go undiagnosed and untreated amongst the lowest earning percentiles simply at least in part because 1) it's unaffordable or not covered by insurance 2) no time to go to sessons
According to her, she was tired of having to go for higher prescriptions every year and wanted a permanent cure.  This appears to be something that bothers quite a number of people with myopia. So, here are a few things that you need to know
Now we should learn from previous generations and rid ourselves of archaic conduct. Some children need more attention and/or help than others. Growing up in Nigeria, you were quickly labelled a bad child or olodo, if you failed consistently. Alot of kids went undiagnosed with
Cancer, heart disease and diabetes are going undiagnosed as Australians fearful of COVID-19 avoid their doctor and worryingly those most at risk are not using new telehealth solutions.
maybe ex oomf was right... i do tweet every thought because ill never truly be known by anyone... or maybe i have a dozen of undiagnosed mental illnesses
"if you're autistic you wouldn't be in university" is wild too bc like. so many autistic people go totally undiagnosed because they're better at masking than others
Undiagnosed but my specialists are beginning to believe at least some of my GI issues aren't Crohn's related since I started having pseudo-obstructions and my colonoscopies generally kinda suggest I'm mostly in remission.
I used to be in them+had private meetings with my favorite teacher, who actually accommodated how I learned and behaved. Once I got into middle school they left me to flounder with my undiagnosed mental illness and math difficulties, making me think I was at fault for failing.
I will add that my own Dad died in 1985 when he had a coughing fit so hard that it brought on a coronary in his bed. No prev heart issues. That sort of stress can be induced on anyone, and if you have undiagnosed issues, well... 
there has got to be a better way of doing the stimulus checks. I am unable to work due to chronic medical conditions to include chiari malformation and dont qualify for social security disability but I have 3 children from a previous marriage that I am the full
I find it difficult to discern fatigue and myalgia from standing all day worrying about and resuscitating patients in #pedsicu from something else related to #covid19. Just me?
They wouldnt give me any $ bc Im curing myself naturally with a naturopathic doctor. Im not a guinea pig for #BigPharma. I also know there are cures for everything, so Im a threat to them. Was undiagnosed for long time, could never build a life, still live w mom + dad.

I'm in the same boat, wife with paralozed vocal cord so can't speak and chronic fibro myalgia, son with autism and struggling at the min, I try to get occasional 5 mins to meself but doesn't happen, I just get me darts and go unwind
Perhaps there's a reason other than homeschooling. Undiagnosed disorders in the parents? My autistic kids need to be taught socialization and it's not easy to do. Some people just don't like other people.
Admits that the paranoid news that's causing people to suffer heart attack and stroke because of 
the statistics are fake and meaningless because the hospitals are refusing patients, which is legal in Japan, and people are dying undiagnosed at home
An (undiagnosed) #autistic girl feels abandoned when her only friend moves away, and tries to battle the stages of grief in order. She discovers that many things in life are illogical and uncontrollable, and learns to cope with those feelings.
man i unnecessarily hated so many people in high school because i ran w the wrong people. wish id known how useless my anger was then. undiagnosed BPD ruins people.
Due to the raging #CoronaBollocks  the impossibility of seeing an optician. How many diabetics or cases of undiagnosed macular degeneration or glaucoma will result in permanent blindness? We'll never know. #endthelockdownuk #BackToWorkNOW
I think this won't work at all in practice because we only have very coarse measures of "brain abnormality" so maternal activities will directly impact cognitive ability through other channels given the coarse measures we can construct.
(I later turned out to have wild undiagnosed ADHD, and in hindsight letting me mess around with 2048 was helping me listen and retain the information he was teaching lmao)
Every one of my representatives have either reneged on the promises based on which I elected them or straight up lied to my face (sometimes both). Would anyone trust or hire a worker with such a track record of self-serving lying? Liberal myopia is becoming my spring catchphrase
Think is they are so thick they dont realise its their generations that will suffer if this is not sorted as quickly as possible. They will die young of undiagnosed cancers  have 2 live in a ruined worlds economy 
Something maybe similar happened to our family. One of my uncles was in 9/11 in the Towers, and after that their family seemed to change a lot. Also my parents are both alcoholics and one has an undiagnosed personality disorder. (Cont)

Estimated that 700,000 (UK) have autism that is undiagnosed. Unfortunately, the diagnostic system is still flawed by gender, age and cultural bias, and therefore unrepresentative of everyone. For example, our early understanding of Autism came from studies of young, western boys.
The disease more near in a long time is a brain nervous bug, two kinds of problem: Body Stability: Ataxia of cerebellum 
condition called Panhypopituitarism, which means that my pituitary gland doesnt produce enough of/any of the hormones it is supposed to normally. For example, it is why I had to be treated with synthetic HGH as a child because I wasnt growing. In 10 I went to
By comparison we're just getting to hear of a disease that's been ravaging Kano this time of year for past few year and yet managed to go completely unreported and undiagnosed..
Story after story about lack of PPE and no routine testing. Hospitals must be full of undiagnosed coronavirus cases among staff and patients. Strokes havent vanished. Patients are dying at home because they are afraid to interact with the healthcare system. Are EDs safe?
Given their heavy drinking, high BP, poor diets, tobacco damaged lungs, undiagnosed stage 2 diabetes, and stress compromised immune systems from their anger and hatred, what percentage will succumb?
She suffered from undiagnosed autoimmune disease for his long?
Cancer sufferers may be going undiagnosed because they are not seeking help from their GP during the coronavirus crisis, Scotlands top doctor has warned.

My mom and I had a heart to heart about relationships and boys and she said sweetheart youre not crazy, you just have undiagnosed borderline personality disorder and I feel so...actually idk how to feel.
 Did you know? based the voice of Red's character on a neurological disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. She was inspired to do so after reading a line in the script, which stated that "She (Red) had not used her voice in many years.".
I know everyone is counting the number of mistakes you make () but it must be difficult dealing with so much club business whilst trying to decipher instructions - and your previously undiagnosed monochrome colour blindness cant help....
Why are and OMT relaxing restrictions while undiagnosed deaths steadily climb, and IC capacity depends on "triaging" the elderly to die at home instead of trying to save them? own data shows even the diagnosed elderly are being hospitalized less while dying more.
Thousands of cancers are going undiagnosed. And people like me  my wife wait to be called for our hip  knee operations! Sure, I can wait, but I can hardly walk my dog!

I am posting our GoFundMe because financial abuse from DV and spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is making it so hard for us to move and we are past our lease. We need help. Promised kids we would never be homeless again. Please  Will pay it forward
My Echolalia is composed of all bad things...like all the nasty things my so called mothers Russian boyfriends family say to me while Im having seizures...my brain and ears somehow pick up on it...subconsciously.

Along with the collateral damage that will be a result of lockdowns, not covid-19. The undiagnosed cancers, the suicides resulting from mental breakdowns and poverty, the domestic abuse victims....I could go on.
You guys know that has undiagnosed Aspergers and as a soothing mechanism, he farts into the mask before putting it on, right?  You all should be ashamed for criticizing this poor man and his affliction!
Thanks for the support. My brother has severe adhd and so I'm always anxious that I may have adhd or autism undiagnosed for me but yeah I relate a lot to animated characters and just want to add more art to people's worlds.
Well, the lockdown will bring  suicides, malnutrition. a surge in domestic abuse and murder, massive economic hardship, unemployment, mental health problems, and a 'time bomb' in terms of undiagnosed cancers and other conditions.  Do these things bring you joy?
We need a lot of help. We are past our lease and MUST move. I have spinocerebellar ataxia 2 so its hard to post a lot today but Im going to try

I have Ataxia which comes under rare diseases and I have been totally ignored and left to fend for myself 
why did it take me until now and looking at the stupid "behind the lyrics" shit on spotify to learn that Basket Case is about undiagnosed panic attacks?????????????? like hello??? this is clearly my anthem how did i not know????? i owe you my life, Green Day lol
2 ) A president should be unifying but he takes a divisive action DAILY. 3.) He has some undiagnosed mental illness that needs to be addressed.

I was just thinking about vertigo and a doctor told me that undiagnosed inner ear problems often accompany concussion/TBI.  I asked him to write an article explaining.  This might be worth looking into.  I hope you find some relief.

i dont know if i am undiagnosed with a something or if im just awkward but i cant handle conversation with anyone and i never make any friendships that last more than a week or two because i fuck up too much and then they start to hate me and i become the annoying friend
Nah man, they have undiagnosed personality disorders spilling out the wazoo and in an effort to make the (online) social world less complex and terrifying need it to adhere to strict black-and-white stated rules.
Kids living with parents who have undiagnosed mental health conditions bear the brunt of the relapses, psychoses and neuroses. As a result, we are also seeing sharp increases in child abuse cases. For some kids, schools or peer-centered environments are safer than their houses.

Talk smoothly and comfortably using natural breathing.   I was diagnosed with focal laryngeal dystonia (commonly known as Spasmodic Dysphonia, or SD) about 20 years ago and it has been surprisingly difficult to manage the condition and still participate in normal life.
When I was young I had an undiagnosed sleeping disorder that I still deal with today.

Yes but thousands of cancers will go undiagnosed because doctor's surgeries and hospitals are closed which because of the lack of early diagnosis will lead to thousands of needless deaths over the coming years. Ask the people who are dying now because chemo is cancelled
#SpecialReport the flu shot does not, as far as we know, confer any protection to covid 19. Medical myopia. From someone not feeling the consequences of his recommendations
Ah! Yes!! I did a whole essay on the symptoms of mental illness in women versus men and how so many women go undiagnosed even when the get tested by a professional cause they only know the signs that show up in men!
OMG you ignorant lot , stop scoring political points at a time like this . 9outof10 ppl said to have died from Clovid 19 really DIED FROM TERMINAL ILLNESS OR ACCIDENT not inc 1s undiagnosed cos of NO POSTMORTEMS or deaths used twice . Flu kills more every winter .
Haha! Yes. A great covid19 mimicker.... anaplasma.... fever cytopenia diarrhea myalgia fatigue and their lab even look similar.... except covid RT PCR negative...
Patients have similar stories ARDS is generally severe Responds to low tidal volume, proning, sedation, inhaled vasodilators, neuromuscular blockade and good critical care Stay organized Round at least 2x a day Complete ICU checklist Avoid oversedation. Got used to #COVID
Dr. "No Treatment" Cuomo has restricted Insulin availability in his state to all those in diabetic shock with a DNR at the hospital only.  Diabetic shock interferes with some covid tests so we'll have to count them as Covid deaths.  #fakenewskills #Genocide2020

growing up autistic but undiagnosed is a really painful experience
The death rate is way too high! High undiagnosed or untested cases has to be the cause, but how in the world can we under-test our nurses! Hospital admin should be sued!

It was one of the most challenging, painful, traumatic things I've been through. Oh, then I lost my job because my employer fired me because i took too much leave  was suffering from undiagnosed post partum depression
We might not even have immunity once infected. Shouldnt you know this before sending millions of people that could have underlying undiagnosed health issues at risk? Please slow down and let the science call the shots or the bloods on your hands.

Can I offer some hope? If you are having to process any type of abuse, or trauma, or undiagnosed childhood disorder, then the long road out to feeling connected to God again can feel endless. Hopeless. As if God is very far away. (He isn't. But it sure does feel like he is.)
my GP told me Im not high risk/vulnerable to covid 19? I have Friedreichs ataxia (a progressive neurological disorder), heart disease and asthma, what else do I need to qualify  ridiculous
bitches were not gifted, they just had undiagnosed ADHD. im bitches 
wbk this always goes for men too. however women do suffer more and women also have the tendency to more often claim they have body dymorphia whilst being UNDIAGNOSED.
It's simple imo. Less access to high quality, nutrient dense food and racially biased healthcare create a generation of people with undiagnosed lifestyle diseases.
I miss the old school SEGA opening where it said it.. I also miss the days that I could play Sonic. Oddly it seems that as I've gotten older, my brain isn't able to keep up with Sonic anymore.. it just moves too damn fast. Thanks a lot autism and chiari 1 malformation.
It's important to understand what cytokine storm does to the body. If you/anyone you know has a mast cell disorder/mastocytosis, social distancing is key. Cytokine storm is what killed so many during the 1918 flu pandemic. This is only one article abt it.
And those RCTs did have dramatic effects on mortality and morbidity. So they had to get ethics approval. That said, it's not quite the same as volunteering to get a disease, since volunteers may have an undiagnosed, underlying condition that could cause death. Hard call
My father in law had autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. It was a struggle to get him anywhere in the short time he had left. Airports, side walks, steep hills, stores, everywhere was a struggle for him and his carers because of the way people stared and interacted with us.
This is my biggest problem with Imtiaz Ali films. He, and his fans, pretend that his men are complex and layered, when they are clearly suffering from some undiagnosed personality issue. Fuck him and fuck this film only. I'm done.
Sadly 60 000 more will die of undiagnosed and untreated cancer because of this lockdown according to Professor Karol Sikora.
i get slightly frustrated by my drawing every 5min and i have to take a break every time ughhhhhhhh i probably have an undiagnosed condition if im being honest
Omg this tweet reminded me of a time on the sub where people would make  mental illnesses thread and wed all just list out all the mental illnesses we had undiagnosed or diagnosed  that was bad
Cannabis helps children with Leukemia, helps Myasthenia Gravis patients improve neuromuscular function, and helps cancer patients going through chemo just for starters but it's considered more dangerous than cocaine and meth by the Feds.

More than that...were seeing gap acidosis and beta hydroxybutyrate levels in people with no DM history - perhaps undiagnosed now responding to ace2 pancreatic activation? Data collection ongoing.

Many adults deny their ADHD. They may remain undiagnosed but the symptoms are real and they cause real problems.
Late diagnosis of autism can cause huge mental health problems arising from masking and needs not being met.
the culture is a very delicate thing and we can fuck it up every day by speaking stupidly, and many do. there's always the war on bad taste, selfishness, stupidity and myopia to legislate  hopefully we smash bad brains into good ones with our ebooks and pictures and such
undiagnosed attention issues/add probably (closes several windows housing multiple tabs, so which are probably duplicates I forgot I opened already). Also already have anxiety so this probably doesn't hit the radar anymore
Question. After reading a number of stories. Is the Corona Virus causing some patients to suffer from Viral Cardiomyopathy where they may have had undiagnosed Hereditary Symptoms.

I've been suffering severe burnout and feeling like trash this year. I'm not in a financial position to get proper testing since itll take time and lots of money. So as an undiagnosed autistic I'd love to know others most calming tics/good feel texturez
I just remembered we had a huge tragedy recently with Zika and real microcephaly so this is not appropriate.  Will cancel and come up with better word of day.
I will get on to her quite frequently for cussing in front of the oldest. Not only is she at that human parrot stage, but also she has Autism and has that Echolalia where when she hears something on TV, she parrots it over and over and over and over.

6 months back in 2016 because of (at the time undiagnosed) Ulcerative Colitis  IBD has periods of flare and remission so it's definitely enforced an attitude of never taking running for granted in me :)
Depression doesnt give people the motivation to do anything. Many people go undiagnosed, but that doesnt mean they arent experiencing it. Yes her room is dirty but the point of the video was to show whoever is dealing with it some motivation to clean. Dont be ignorant.
I was in my mid 30s before childhood developmental trauma was diagnosed. Btwn trauma, hyper vigilance and wonky prioperception due to undiagnosed Ehlers-Danlos, I developed central sensitisation syndrome (FYI, this is why early intervention is important)
I have an eye condition (asides from myopia) named strabismus which means every time I try to focus my sight on a certain spot one of my eyes just goes its own way, like this. I had surgery and got 80% off but some of it still there
And some/all have stopped diagnostic procedures to work on covid19 with no estimate of when new appointments will be made. If ever. So another ill-health time bomb lurks. If those undiagnosed people survive long enough that is.
I dont know you well enough to be more specific, unfortunately. Ive had a long career in software  worked with quite a few people with Aspergers or sub-clinical undiagnosed autism. Sometimes, it works out.

Why are parents allowing their kids to watch these sensory nightmares, especially if their kid is undiagnosed for asd and NDs???
Looking back I bet a lot of it was my undiagnosed ADHD and teachers in the Chicago ghetto don't give a fuck ab anything esp not their students so they just got mad at me for not being able to sit still/focus and interrupting class and not remembering shit instead
Myopia obviously afflicted me. In general terms, still(!) think Saudi purchase of NUFC is unusual  inconsistent with KSA sport policy. I also thought the Gulf feud had gone quiet  relations between fractious neighbours were thawing. But of course, I had forgotten this....

It's called chiari malformation, so like. This. It's not super dangerous but not treatable either, it causes me dizziness when im stressed and sometimes i just kinda. Collapse. Don't pass out but lose control of my body for a moment. Not dangerous unless i hit smth

My medical records do NOT document the sudden onset foot clawing after 14-15 Sep 2012 deterioration (cold white leg, undiagnosed DVT - Nurse Monserat Allen refused me any NHS help) following 26 Aug 2012  attendance, 5 Sep 2012 Dr Macnair GP attendance; all refused me crutches.
How many ppl aren't going to the doctor because they're afraid to go out? Clinics they go to are closed because of no patients.  How many people will die from undiagnosed cancer screenings?
The hospitals are laying off their employees and shutting down their clinics. How many people will die from undiagnosed cancer, heart disease, etc and are living in severe pain because they cannot see patients and do surgeries?  How about we shut down some abortion clinic?
I not sure but I think I read 50 thousand might die of cancer and other illnesses because of cancellation of appointments and people having undiagnosed illnesses because of not seeing a doctor in time  thats the ticking time bomb
???  Just saw Cable news clip with Dr discussing small % of younger(30-40s) Covid patients developing thrombosis,stroke, issues?  Undiagnosed Vascular? Complications of connective tissue comorbid with Covid? Symptoms sure sounded like it?
35 years Lyme  5 TBD's, 7 years undiagnosed. Finally broke down  sought testing- 2 days to obtain appt. Told 2-5 days for result. Too late for HCQ/az combo by then. Scared  angry.

My male gyn lied to me  told me he tested me for certain things, he never did. told me I had PCOS, which I dont. all so he could make money off of a program he wanted to put me on. Ive had endometriosis my whole life and it went undiagnosed until I was 23, now its at stage 4
Interesting query dealt with today, one of the ward fridges went out of range for over an hour in the night. Stock including neuromuscular blockers being used in covid patients which are currently like gold. Had to use and ring around manufacturers. Problems solved !

Plus a mandatory order for a chest x-ray to be done as soon as possible because my lung performance is not great. Tomorrow I have to go to the hospital and before the x-ray I have to get Covid screened. This is all to say I'm a little stressed and might have undiagnosed asthma.
This is poor attempt at trolling congress and the American people during the onset of the Pandemic, or thats what he wants us to believe.  The reality is that this man suffers from undiagnosed aspergers and farts into the mask as a soothing mechanism. #FloridaMorons
Many of them do indeed suffer from poor mental health, ie. undiagnosed or untreated schizophrenia, untreated PTSD, etc.

So many Father's are undiagnosed - The relationships end - Men don't realise it impacts on them by witnessing their loved ones go through trauma - I find it hard to believe The biggest killer in men under 50 is suicide and we don't screen new Dad's!! #HowAreYouDad
 cuz I have nothing to prove! Some of us have dyslexia that went undiagnosed lol
I'm not sure how/when this belief of "mental health as identity being a threat" has reached actual psychologists, but I can't believe the risk of over-identifying took over the complications of being undiagnosed and acting weird in a society that expects you to be reliable.

Many who suffer from obesity will never find success in dieting because they are actually food addicts. Not weak. Not undisciplined. No failing. MISDIAGNOSED or UNDIAGNOSED. 
Their myopia of the whole process seriously has them thinking they can extort us into thinking about this election and the stakes on the line in their terms and POV. We cant do that b/c we are actually oppressed and under greater, sustained attack. The WWC still has it better.
Animal Farm, Clockwork Orange, Fahrenheit 451, to name a few, read in high school may have informed the under educated about the instant political situation. Myopia is bad.
Theres such a trend of autism researchs  caretakers later finding out that they are also autistic 
You realize it really is due to his undiagnosed dementia right?
What about people with undiagnosed autism or sensory issues, who get called "picky" and internalize it? Why do you get to make that judgment on them? Where do you draw that line? How arrogant to assume that we know better than someone else knows their own body
Finally watched the video.I dont know what the boy might be going through,if he has some undiagnosed learning disability or not,or if hes just an Ekwensu sent to frustrate his parents.But I felt the fathers pain. No one would sit calmly and watch their child throw his life away
They get diagnosed at: physicals, and visits this sore wont heal or tender spot or lump....these visits arent happening.

So I tested negative last Tuesday (day 1 of symptoms) and went back to work. Last two days fevers up to 39degrees, awful headache and myalgia. No retest available so am off work for seven days. I cant imagine this is anything else? Hope you feel better soon Zack!
Undiagnosed cancers/early detection and early treatment which leads to higher survivability is not being done because meh virus.  A virus with a fatality rate of .3%.  They are killing people.  In new york cuomo said nursing homes cant discriminate bc of corona. They must accept.
This is truly damning. Criminal negligence. The PM went on holiday(s), the government didnt act  a decade of austerity  Brexit myopia gutted our preparations for an event that was a) inevitable  b) the 2016 exercise told us we were underprepared for.
Why is NG like this! Why must outsiders tell us we have fly infested wounds before we act?! Is it a case of mental myopia? I served in 1997 and problem was there. 20+ years after, problem is still alarming. We cannot neglect children + look forward to a glorious future!
Yes, Ive been surprised to see that none of the news / science articles mentioning cytokine storms mention mast cells. I did see Dr Afrin posted a memo hypothesizing that younger healthy people w/ severe cases may have had undiagnosed MCAS, hence their severity.

I didn't mention 5G but she sent me packing with an as yet undiagnosed condition. I only gave her my chest symptom, and not the other two. So she sent me away with an undiagnosed condition, that's wrong on every level.

Thanks. MS's auto-immune but its still unknown what causes it. My ataxia's hereditary. Vaccines only prevent diseases or protect from pathogens. I was recently cured of hepatitis with a medicine tho. I hope my wife  I can one day be cured with a medicine or a medical treatment.
Undiagnosed type 1 diabetes in children is a medical emergency and can be life threatening. If your child has ANY key symptoms #4Ts make an urgent GP appt. The NHS can keep you safe. Do not stay away because of Covid-19

Does anyone else go though random episodes where they feel the need to clean and decorate everything immediately and cant stop until its done or do I just have an undiagnosed mental disorder
I am suffering from Crohn's disease. Of course I have to be picky. Not everyone has the luxury not to. Maybe some people has trauma related to food. Maybe some undiagnosed problem. Maybe they don't want to. Stop being a tyrant about food.
thank you for saying this! ocd has also ruined my life so seeing undiagnosed people throw the word around and simply using so ocd as a way of saying such a perfectionist is really irritating and disappointing. being a perfectionist is a completely different thing altogether.
"30 is old" seems like such a weird atavism from like a century ago. Also probably something about 30 feeling old when you spent your entire 20s with undiagnosed PTSD from getting drafted, and then marrying someone you realize you don't really love, and drinking constantly
i want to blame undiagnosed mental illnesses lmao. im so fucking mad that i still know the stupid lyrics to both songs jfc
Hearing reports from California friends  family, working in nursing homes, that every resident sent to the hospital, was immediately sent back, undiagnosed, untreated, never having seen a doctor, as no hospital would accept them.  Thinking there needs to be an investigation...
Trump: "I'm a businessperson. I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them." So he fired the entire CDC pandemic response team (2018) due to his severe myopia. Con men don't know how to plan long term. It's about short term win. 
It is my solemn prayer that we seize moment. This hope is however dampened by the usual ongoing political undercurrents  MORESO  citizen myopia in critically calling the bluff. Guess we need more plagues to say enuff is enuff
So true. I have been waiting for an appointment with a neuromuscular specialist for possible MS since the middle of March. Why do I have to continue to suffer when you can go shopping but can't see a specialist?
u all have an undiagnosed mental illness i think
i blame it on undiagnosed adhd and depression
Honestly think a lot of those guys are struggling with diagnosed or undiagnosed body dysmorphia.
Sorry to lose any life. More so for a doctor.  Was he the pilot too? His myopia did not save him. Doctors do bury their mistakes.  It will be helpful if we try harder to help those who think we were  created for others to tell us how they will saveus from ourse!ves. God disagrees
Amazing episode for #AutismAwarenessMonth with addressing the reasons females often go undiagnosed until later in life.
Could be? My mum sang the words to the tune of the nursery rhyme and certain keys set me off as a little undiagnosed autistic kid so maybe it was that? I remember the idea of that book being Painful.
Starvation, suicide, dying from undiagnosed cancers, severe tooth pain, glaucoma, destroying people's life's work and dreams - don't you know suffering all of that IS FAR BETTER THAN A SINGLE COVID-19 DEATH!!!!!!
I couldnt imagine going through this pandemic with undiagnosed and unmedicated anxiety/depression. I was diagnosed last year for a reason.
Pls i need help for my son he is diagnose microcephaly with cleft palate we dont have income because of pandemic... we need to buy his basic needs... thank you and godbless
Great radio documentary The next #GREYRHINO, #GRAYRHINO Perhaps all those undiagnosed #Cancer patients isolating or not seeking medical advice for red flag symptoms #NHS  #COVID19 #REDFLAG-Ca. CALL YOUR DOCTOR!
Okay, okay, sound points. But there's no discussion of the profound problems with our medical system. People are volunteering for the emergency room with serious, oft contagious conditions(COVID-19 is not singular) and being sent away undiagnosed and transmissive. It's quackery
I use my phone to put up stories then lose it for 3hrs its called undiagnosed ADHD on my part
Hi Jeffery! I am a mom of a beautiful 5 year old girl who has epilepsy, hypotonia and is immuno compromised. Right now she is battling viral pneumonia so my husband who is our only income is home with us while we care for our daughters. #jefferystarapproved
There are a lot of people dying from cardiac and other complications ccaused by unreported and undiagnosed cases of Covid-19. There are also a lot of people with other issues who arent going to the hospital because theyre afraid of catching Covid-19.
The reporting suggests a US system that's like a leaky dam. A shortage of testing means some cases go undiagnosed. A shortage of tracing means that some people who are exposed are not warned. A lack of proper quarantine means some people continue the spread.

Should also note that many autistic adults go undiagnosed until late in life. 
Have you not heard what Sting said about this? Sting had an undiagnosed neck issue. Anyone could of hit a buckle bomb and the same thing would have happened.
I cant speak for CFS as I dont have it. ME is caused by an enterovirus and is deffo a neuromuscular illness similar to Gravis.
Exactly. Its a huge waste of resources to randomly test otherwise perfectly healthy people who may be fine today and infected tomorrow. An antibody test would identify those who have been positive but undiagnosed, for better quantification of the viral impact.
me at 10:57pm not tweeting abt undiagnosed mental illness and crying myself to sleep 3 times a week bc oversharing on twitter is ugly send tweet

In the UK, around 30,000 people were diagnosed with cancer last April. This month, it'll probably be around 5,000 because people are worried about burdening the NHS. If thousands die because they didnt seek vital treatment, then lockdown will have been in vain.
also not just them but me too in I had no idea ab the possibility of me being undiagnosed austistic until a few years ago when i started hs but I pushed it aside. Gladly I looked into it and the more I learned about it I realized it truly has been me all along I just feel seen
I have myopia and astigmatism i go and test my eyesight every year and we don't have this
Not sure about the cause. Genetics? Undiagnosed food allergy? Maybe dehydration? I get enough sleep and Ive been off sugar/carbs for long periods of time in the past couple years. My foundation has a low-level sunscreen.
i found the ginger tea i bought three years ago cause i thought it might help with my undiagnosed digestive problems but turns out it was krnz and ginger is not an fda approved treatment
Oh fuckkkk yeah, shes sneaky as hell. Biggest liar Ive ever met lol. Shes super dramatic, but she was def always the mom that would pick my friends  me up from parties. My friends thought she was fun but she totally had undiagnosed mental health issues. Shes a Taurus sun

My wife's defect went undiagnosed until late 20s. Monitored semi annually; no change in 10+ years. Only consequence: doctors leery about full anesthetic when our daughter was born (she still got it  it went fine). When caught in time, many things can be managed. Best of luck
A JOKEN au wherein JOSH had a myopia that caused him from losing his vision and it's funny how fate works because before he lose his vision the last person he saw was KEN.
Thinking today about the undiagnosed ADHD folk who have been self medicating with adrenaline from ultra intense workplaces, sometimes for decades. 
I cant take tweets that have lots of hashtags, lots of mentions or many different emojis. They make me dizzy. When I am mentioned in one, I just mute the conversation.

Sorry for the long thread but I just felt right now, this lockdown is horrible and I can't imagine going through it undiagnosed so maybe a good news story would maybe give someone a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel

being undiagnosed as an autistic child or adult doesn't mean i'm not autistic, it means that i'm not receiving the tools and support that i need.
 how bout I add some deaths for those undiagnosed because of the lack of testing
Actually, due to the disastrous response in testing, the number of actual COVID deaths are most likely understated. In addition, the reported numbers only reflect the deaths that occurred in hospitals or nursing homes. Doesnt include those who died at home undiagnosed. Try again
My dad was a missionary teacher in Kenya for over a decade. He had undiagnosed dementia. He had an awful time seeing Kenyans as his equal. Not everyone at the school felt that way, but many did  #whitesaviors
At a guess, underlying and also undiagnosed conditions may hold the key to both. Things like diabetes for the BAME community, and greater likelihood of lung disease and other undiagnosed illnesses in men. Both definitely need investigation.
Major depression also affects older adults, teens, and children, but frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated in these populations.
My grandmother had an illness known as Friedreicht Ataxia. Because of 1000s of rapes made in incest within the Hitler bloodline. But thanks be to Jesus Christ! His Blood purified Mines; made Me Successful.
One of the things that caught my attention here vs other online disability spaces was how prevalent it seemed to be to have comunity members who are chronically ill  undiagnosed or, at best, partially diagnosed.
Actually, I think it's an important discussion to bring up at this time. Too many children with learning disabilities go through school undiagnosed  without support, get labeled stubborn/lazy/dense by adults and end up avoiding academics as a whole. There's research on this.

lol I had no idea I had dyscalculia for most of my life, but somehow I got through it despite a HS math teacher actually saying to me "You have to actually think in this class, Sarah." When I talk to others w/learning disabilities, they're amazed I got through it all undiagnosed.
An autopsy revealed that Klausutis had an undiagnosed heart condition and a coroner concluded she passed out and hit her head as she fell. The coroner said the head injury caused the death, but she wasnt struck by another person.

Democrat states been inflating coronavirus numbers for weeks. Many states followed corrupt New York's example of attributing the undiagnosed dead as coronavirus dead. They called it "presumptive."
The thousands of undiagnosed at-home deaths, the otherwise inexplicable jumps in pneumonia deaths and mortality we are already seeing and know must be Covid-19. Trump will try to discard those and then well see what Fauci is made of.
or players families? and what do you do if a player tests positivequarantine the entire team? does that mean they forfeit 2 weeks worth of games? what if a seemingly healthy player has an undiagnosed ailment and dies? so many questions ....

It was a pre-emptive peace prize, and he went on to bring Slavery to Africa and flood the Sahel with misery. The Nobel Peace Prize lost all meaning due to this myopia. Perhaps Obama would have worked for peace had he not allready been awarded it. But congrats on Iran and Cuba.
Is it revealed later on Too Hot To Handle that all the contestants are undiagnosed sex addicts. Or are all super hot people sex addicts? Or is it the super hot and super dumb? I guess Matthew isnt SUPER dumb but you know...                                    Its a great show.
I had to reread this to recall the EXACT phrasing of your comment    regarding having a touch of undiagnosed OCD. A future daughter-in-law once kindly diagnosed me with ADHD. I hadnt recalled that until a read your piece. I love the literary flow of this article.
Some of my friends have undiagnosed ADHD and it really shows
COVID-19 deaths is increasing as many undiagnosed people die, this is the sight of funeral procesions. Every govt directive has since been ignored. It's disheartening to see people trying so hard to politicize the fight against #Covid_19.

Some lawyer, avoiding the facts lol. No it is not binary, your myopia will cost lives. If you had guts or brains about you, youd be protesting the Dem power grab that suppressed primary votes + cost lives. Youd be pushing for the country to Unite Green. You need new cud to chew

You continue to show your myopia. Youre clearly bored. Youre clearly not very smart. You clearly have no lateral thinking ability. Smoke if you want! Just know that you have a good chance to contract this viral infection. And just know that your chances to survive is not good.
This should have been stopped! Hes irresponsible, incompetent, immoral, disrespectful, anegomaniac, racist, and sexist with an undisclosed/undiagnosed mental disorder who comes to these briefings just because there are cameras there. He sees and uses reporters as paparazzi
possible undiagnosed dyspraxia, possibly his body is trying to sabotage his food crime before he can insult millions of years of evolution by putting that in his mouth
Are you serious? That can kill you if gone untreated. .y best friend's daughter had Chiari, a tethered cord  70 scoliosis at age 15. She had 3 separate major surgeries to deal with it. She's now in her early 20's  doing great. Had the surgeries not been done she could've died

BEFORE test was found to fail 71%, 300,000-1.5 million NEW #lyme cases/ YEAR expected. Many are undiagnosed  at risk for coronavirus, putting others at risk too. Many with #Lyme dont get sick until a serious illness. Will test negative for Lyme by then.
Unemployment, poverty, loneliness, domestic abuse, diseases going undiagnosed because hospitals wont see you,
We all wont agree on how deadly CV19 is.  Can we all agree that our economic disruption will lead to some increase in suicide, overdose, death by undiagnosed mammograms, etc, and some starvation in marginalized 3rd world countries?
He didnt fire every inept  corrupt #CDC bureaucrat? The whole agency? CDCs corrupted #lymeDisease 45 years  requiring Only their employee-owned 71% false-negatives test be used. Millions undiagnosed w/ #lyme=immune compromised  many dont get sick til after a serious illness
Anecdotally, its been spreading here since December: people with #COVI19 symptoms, but undiagnosed because Drs. didnt know what they were looking at.

Callosal angle is not necessarily related to hydrocephalus. It is actually used to distinguish ventriculomegaly vs DESH (disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus), which is seen with iNPH. Neurosurgeons sometimes ask for it because it predicts shunt response
Thank you for tag. Very very uncomfortable reading and its absolutely SEND related. Children in care are 5 times more likely to have undiagnosed SEND. These whole sale changes are desperately concerning.

They appear to be suffering from an acute case of latent psychosis with neurotic overtones. Quite possibly some undiagnosed chemical dependencies. Hey, thats just my opinion. 
You really aint got shit do in quarantine huh? And content can refer to anything you put out on the internet, get educated, by the way, you're trying to start shit with someone who has had multiple spine surgeries and had chiari malformation. Hope you feel big and strong big boy.
Even as new #COVID19 cases start to decline across the nation, the positivity rates on #coronavirus tests being performed remain high -- reflecting an epidemic that's still underway.
Youre missing the point, Mike. I dont support Trump. You got me already. Try to be less simple-minded and myopic. Myopia will be treatable under Medicare4All (psychological disorders covered). Try that for a little inspiration. Get to work for your Icons of the Elite!
I was really struggling post uni because I had undiagnosed ADHD. Since being diagnosed and accepting it Ive honestly found strength, purpose and liberation. When I started my masters the first assignment I did was about my career journey and adhd, it was so liberating
Teaaaaaa! Robert Kennedy Jr. blatantly has spasmodic dysphonia in his voice from being a bad sport. Caugh Caugh * playing the Abusive Spouse Card. NOT from solitary adult psychotic episodes beside his bedroom dresser.  We all know those are completely stable in quinquagenarians.
Microcephaly is a medical condition in which the brain does not develop properly, resulting in a shorter-than-normal head.The disorder is caused by a disruption to the genetic processes that form the brain early in pregnancy.
Yes, lots of reports of dysphagia  dysphonia. Not to mention all the other rehab needs not being met right now. Lots of work for our community colleagues especially. Now is the time more than ever for #MDT working. Thanks for sharing Thomas.
Think the death rate %, are misleading. As they only account, for hospitalised, cases.
thinking about how a lot of people who "don't like conflict" are dealing with undiagnosed, untreated trauma around disagreements, arguments, or confrontations that were unhealthy, to say the least, and responding to emotional flashbacks or other misunderstood sources of stress.
Damning report in The Times; BoJo missing five Cobra sessions, Hancock and co failing to understand basic science. But the broader story is the myopia of austerity - necessary cuts that have cost this country many many times what it saved. The inquiry had better recognise that

Fwiw it was coeliac disease which could have led to stomach cancer had it been left undiagnosed. As it was I was severely underweight and it took years for my system to recover
Im symptomatic for COVID-19 and been swabbed. I had myalgia, fatigue, night sweats and a very mild occasional cough, but stubbornly normal temp for several days, then it began episodes of spiking to ~38.4C. Sore throat later, no anosmia. Pretty mild case, hope it stays that way.

Calm down. Yikes. When a psychologist makes a diagnosis and tells a family doc to prescribe a med, I get concerned.
All kidding aside...these people need to sign "no medical treatment" waivers!  They are now spitting on the very healthcare workers they will depend on in a few weeks and they should not be treated!!
Give me liberty or give me death. Those that continue to espouse this shutdown, dont consider the consequences that are mounting, the deaths from undiagnosed medical problems, rural hospital disruption, financial ruin, hunger, suicides, etc.

iI just got result 'Cutting all the sleeves off your t-shirts' on quiz 'Which of my undiagnosed ADHD activities are you'. What will you get?
It's not that simple. What's a pre-existing condition? What about those with an undiagnosed condition? What about genetic susceptibility (thought to play a role in severity)? There are healthy under 45s who are dying now. Would it be acceptable for more to do so?

I'm not arguing against remdesivir.  There have been studies which have demonstrated apparent effectiveness.  HOWEVER, "severe disease" tells me nothing definitive, and I haven't seen any study which has demonstrated definitive/consistent effectiveness on severely ill patients.

Gosh, this will take more than 140 characters. Let's start with the massive bruises that appeared out of nowhere. The dizziness. The abrupt and gushing nosebleeds. The injuries that ripped flesh but never broke bones. The undiagnosed dyslexia/dyscalculia (called me lazy.) etc.
Brilliant! My late diagnosis made so much sense of my family history. And very often when addressing a #autistic audience I see "echoes of the future" in undiagnosed parents, some who call back a year or two later to say "you'll never guess what...".

Reports of nurses etc dying at home despite calling for an ambulance; pretty sure that's the tip of the iceberg*, (just like all the undiagnosed VTE that die at home untreated because GPs etc miss them, when there's no pandemic). *Because media reports interested in nurses deaths
A S/E of aminoglycosides is a neuromuscular blockade drug. Because there is already NM-blockade in myasthenia gravis from the autoantibodies, aminoglycosides can further prolong the NM-blockade, putting the patient more at risk for respiratory failure and death.

In some of our studies, we define someone as symptomatic with an acute respiratory illness if they have two or more new symptoms (e.g. sore throat and myalgia) but paucisymptomatic if they only have one (e.g. myalgia). I havent used it outside of a research setting.

Honestly I'd probably give JK Rowling one if she said Luna Lovegood had undiagnosed autism. Like its cheep but there is ample evidance to suport this in the text and I'm a believer in saying that an auistic person doesnt have to divulge that fact about themselves.

Same, my man. I got chubby at like 11 and had a lot of respiratory infections and undiagnosed asthma till I was 16. There was just a point in my early teens when I let that become the picture of myself in my mind and leaned in. I'd give a lot to do those years over

This NYTs theory that NYC had 10k undiagnosed cases of COVID in Feb. Mom  I were in NYC then. I was so sick Feb 10-19 (says Miss FitBit), I made Mom stay her sister's in Jersey. However, Mom didn't get sick. I assumed it was AnselFlu, too bad I can't get tested for antibodies.
Chinese have done the same, yet millions in US remain untested and undiagnosed. US numbers much higher, hidden from world, US lies, people die. We need tests, lots of test. Get them, do your job. Quit listening to Trump, he is only working for himself.
This man infuriates me. I guess I ain't the target market. The Spiritual myopia  lack of judgement is unsettling. I guess the new age churches are just a batch of capitalistic pyramids schemes (Allegedly). No matter how much of a believer I am, I will never do this.
My older son's 2nd grade teacher was Black and she was a wonder. He's dyslexic  dysgraphic - very much undiagnosed back then - and she worked with him so well, showed him his strengths. W/o her influence I doubt he'd have made it to Jr. High. Most faculty still white then though
TAKE CARE OF YOUR MENTAL HEALTH BEFORE YOU HAVE KIDS. So many things wrong with people can be traced back to their undiagnosed mothers or unmedicated fathers. If you dont get how someone can angrily do dishes at you, your parents did a good job
A NYC conundrum: after getting an undiagnosed illness, do you leave the relative safety of your house to go get tested for antibodies or stay home?

They also have a lot of undiagnosed folks who should have duel diagnosis in the studies messing with the results as often medics stop at the first diagnosis. It would be more efficient to screen for everything and take that into consideration in studies and look for interactions.

Failing2ask: what %pop "pre-symptomatic" #covid19 with #oxygen level below 94%? (#hypoxia =early sign of undiagnosed  left   die
That's one of the topics in discussions; do some have undiagnosed hypercoagulability? But we definitely know it increases risk of thrombosis even without it. 
We have to expect several side effects in chronic carriers or re-infected patients. As observed with Measles and HTLV-1, a variety of dermatological, ophthalmic and neuromuscular symptoms due to dysregulation of T-cell immunity can develop in chronically infected patients
This lot are slaughtering us on all fronts, Herd Immunity theory plus eugenics and our numbers will keep falling, long after the pandemic has gone

The one I kept during an undiagnosed ED was the most upsetting one. I sound proper loopy in it.
My son had (undiagnosed, because they refused to test him-doc said it was anyway) C-19 at the end of Feb. By the time he was better, we had a stay at home order. He's rarely left the house in almost 2 months. Kid is starting to crack.

GFs mother received her results 25 days after testing. told she was positive and to tell anyone she'd been in contact with in the 3.5 weeks about it. In the interim one of her friends has passed away. It 100% covid but won't show in stats as it was undiagnosed.

I might be suffering from something similar. But I'm attributing it to undiagnosed autism
dudes be basing their personalities on undiagnosed mental illnesses fr
Just a thought...how many cases of heart disease, cancer screenings, and other diseases which exponentially dwarf the Covid19 mortality have gone undiagnosed since the lockdowns?
Thank you so much for opening up and discussing this. PTSD in one form or another, is apart of my daily life. Experiencing it and being in the company of so many who both are diagnosed  undiagnosed...I am grateful  proud that you're in therapy! 
If my state reopens a month from now, I still will not go back to normal.  We need a vaccine. Too many people never followed the rules, too many undiagnosed, too many infected rest homes. Eating out, shopping at the mall, going to theaters...not worth being sick or dying.
Health officials have said there are likely thousands more undiagnosed cases in the region, partly due to limited testing.

Thats what SCHIZOPHRENICS do! They lie. trump is an UNDIAGNOSED PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC!!
I have 10+ chronic illnesses and others that are undiagnosed. Sadly I can't get tested for them for awhile. And can only get minimal help managing my health issues currently due to the pandemic. So I'm just doing what I can while working with specialists over the phone.
Mr.Bill, I've been suffering from amblyopia on my left eye which need a surgical operation and also I have myopia which can be cured by LASIK.
There are likely millions of undiagnosed immune deficiency cases in the US. Realistically these are silent carriers of #covid19 (among other things)positive on PCR but negative by serology (antibody test).
#UndiagnosedDay Non-diagnosed #patients have a lower quality of life which decreases day by day. But we can help change that by approaching a 360 degrees perspective on the symptoms through a  study. Be part of the #research
And knowing what we do about the state of primary care in the US, we can make an educated guess that much of the population, especially rural, red-state populations, are living with uncontrolled/undertreated/undiagnosed chronic conditions type 2 diabetes being one of the biggies
#WeNeedACureFor Ataxia and other neuro-degenerative diseases I may have forgotten
He didnt mean of China Virus, doh. He meant all the undiagnosed things like cancer that will be missed during the LD.
Its a ticking time bomb. Lets hope and pray that it does not explode. Honestly awam is responsible for its spread. There will be many undiagnosed and those could be the lethal carriers. Only isolation and social distancing can help. But awam him its a joke still.

Not quite due to "this"paid for my annual winter group training program while trying to power through an undiagnosed stress fracture. Didn't show up to a single workout; now glad I never looked into a refund since it wound up being scrapped for everyone.
lrt it can also cause animosity between gifted and on-level students AND from my experience gifted kids are mostly asians whose parents are immigrants and dont know what mental health is so their neurodivergence goes undiagnosed
Whos responsible for undiagnosed cancers and closure of rural hospitals who are financial distress as a result of lockdown?  If those deaths exceed COVID, the blood is on the hands of the lockdown brigade.
I was soon after diagnosed with myopia, my right eye worse than my left. now I always have my pair on except in certain conditions
As an ER nurse I believe we need to open elective surgeries because people are suffering. We need to allow mammograms  dental cleanings. Allow knee  hip replacements. People are suffering  will die from undiagnosed breast cancer.

The coronavirus had a 5.1% mortality rate and that only includes those diagnosed with it and not the asymptomatic undiagnosed. The Founding Fathers would be ashamed to see how many people want to take away the rights of the people over a virus.

I was never good enough at school to be in the gifted programs. And that's on undiagnosed mental problems
Hospitals have never been quieter. If the current NHS situation continues for much longer the general level of morbidity in society will be huge due to untreated/undiagnosed diseases and conditions.
Hey guys, I get kidney stones, and have a chiari malformation... where do i go to protest that ailment?
a 75 per cent drop in urgent referrals in England. Cancers of the lung, stomach and throat are thought particularly likely to have been affected because of concerns the procedures necessary to diagnose them may expose medical staff to Covid-19.
To conspiracists saying random deaths are being ascribed to COVID to inflate numbers: Even if true, you have to accept the opposite is also true, that there are thousands of COVID deaths undiagnosed, especially early when there was no testing. Ill wager column B is much higher.
The flu kills people- even some who get the vaccine...the point of the story is to keep the sheep scared and so many willing sheep its pathetic.
Many Americans suffer from chronic pelvic pain which leads to other associated problems. Dont let it go undiagnosed, be sure to ask about Pelvic Floor physical therapy. #PT #PhysicalTherapy
The odds that one of those children is undiagnosed IC is VERY HIGH. It's not like police are locking up parents because they want too. They're doing it because the parents are being reckless. And the officer said, "I don't want to arrest you". She literally said, "Arrest me",
It is an autoimmune disorder of the nervous system characterized by new movements of the limbs and eyes, abnormal behaviors, sleep dysregulation, and difficulty talking.
According to Dr Kraft, the pathology that often ends in a T2DM diagnosis need not get there. You might die from CVD first- so no, it's not inevitable. 
For the first time the National Sexual Assault Hotline says the majority of its calls are coming from minors. Many were "a direct result of COVID-19, because they were quarantined with their abuser. The abuser was now abusing them on a daily basis."
Mine told me that, too. I told her that her only problems were myopia and dementia.
Laurie, I am also wondering when we will start to see fetal anomalies-deafness, microcephaly, etc based on intrauterine exposure. I guess we're not far enough into the timeline yet, but I can't imagine that there isn't some teratogenesis with this thing.
Plus deaths from yet undiagnosed heart disease (stress tests cancelled) and many other potentially terminal conditions which will go undiagnosed until too late.

Many who live with Neuromuscular Disease are prescribed noninvasive ventilation and are placed on AVAPS. What is that, you ask? Watch this short animation to find out. 
#RENTRELIEF please see me. We MUST move and due to my ex causing financial abuse and DV I require a larger deposit. He already made us homeless once when I had both knees replaced. Plus I have spinocerebellar ataxia 3 please see us
And that doesnt include the skipped cancer screenings, avoided childhood vaccinations, missed biopsies of now-undiscovered cancers numbering thousands per week  and countless other serious disorders left undiagnosed.

Too bad Florida is one of the very worst states as far as lack of testing goes.  So these numbers mean almost nothing, and undiagnosed and untested people continue to infect Floridians across the state.

I don't think she should have lied about it. If she's been in treatment and the doctor said she's good, then disclose that.  If not, disclose that. It's not a 100% guarantee you won't get in. In my case, it was undiagnosed. Military service could exacerbate her problem.
How do we know who is high risk. We see a lot of ppl with no pmh dying and unfortunately we have so many people who dont visit the md and have undiagnosed issues. So in this country how do we identify who is high risk.

And absolute morons in government are talking about opening the states when we have more than 10s the infected in the country and god knows how many undiagnosed.
We ordered a lock down taking away people's freedom, created vast unemployment numbers and massive deficits and allowed people to go with undiagnosed sickness because they're too scared to go to clinics and get tests, because 1000 more people are going to die than a flu season!
It's almost like people were dying with COVID, undiagnosed bc trump set up a chokehold on diagnostic tests so that his "numbers won't look so bad", stocks would flourish, and he'd coast to re-election.

Same deal here. They keep talking about daily deaths, but its just those counted in hospital, not those undiagnosed at home, not all the care home residents they threw under a bus with no PPE, no guidance and even discharge of covid patients from hospital back into care homes.

Agreed JC, thats why I had to RT it! I couldn't care less about some of the tragically misguided "is Rashida Jones black enough to play the part" debates online. It's the racial essentialism, cultural myopia that really sinks the series as writes #ItsAlsoNotFunny
AU numbers are from all tests (hospital, GP, drive-through, etc). However, I agree, there will be a number of undiagnosed cases in the community BUT they are not resulting in hospitalisation due to more serious complications which bodes well for relaxation of social distancing.
Naintindihan ko naman, ur suffering and still undiagnosed. Pero, after years of gaslighting, I want to finally have that ability to speak out and gut-punch u for everything you did wrong. Ur disorder is not ur get away card from being held accountable.

Youre all correct to a point. The problem with releasing the under 50 healthy crowd is that while they feel and look healthy, they might still have undetected and undiagnosed health issues that would make it dangerous.
tbh i think its ok to give mentally ill ppl leeway and not automatically label them an abu*er when they start to show symptoms and act out bc there is a period of time of going undiagnosed where they are unaware of their illness and that theyre acting differently than others
especially the sound it makes when you botch it up...like tossing a tshirt in the garbage disposal...i think i may have some undiagnosed ptsd over that now that i think about it lol

You are risking a second peak caused by the lockdown. People may not die of covid 19 but the longer this goes on people will die of undiagnosed cancer, heart disease, they will die of poverty, suicide and our children will suffer for years.
Early on, back in January  February I read about unusual muscle cramping, different from the myalgia. I havent read it recently. Also, Ive read reports of psychosis and schizophrenic affects

I want everyone to realize how EVIL capitalism is. These states are reopening knowing that there are those undiagnosed and spreading the virus. The proper way to combat this is to push your own hubris and selfish needs OUT a majority of these things are LUXURIES.

I've come to believe that diagnostic algorithms are part of the problem of patients staying undiagnosed for a long time and dismissing patients - because they favor some conditions over others. Conditions that are thought to be more common or that have received more attention.

And here's a neat trick: When medical science CANNOT deduce the cause of an illness, by default, the illness gets labeled "somatic," caused by the person's undiagnosed mental illness.
And, these numbers don't include the undiagnosed from insufficient testing.  There are thousands - both living  deceased who were not tested- but "unofficially diagnosed " - so they're not included in our counts.

This isnt just drugs. This is likely what started as an undiagnosed mental health disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and childhood trauma which resulted in drug use.
In October, the US military went to Wuhan for the World Military Games. There were soldiers who were sick, and COVID-19 broke out a month later. It is a possibility that the sick American soldiers at the games might have had undiagnosed COVID-19, and brought it to Wuhan.
It gives me a smidge of hope, actually. I suspect there are a lot of healthy individuals out there with undiagnosed autoimmune disorders which could be whats triggering the cytokine storms. If immunosuppressants can be used to counter/prevent the worst symptoms, that is HUGE.
Man I wish I had gotten the courage to wear fun outfits in high school instead of daily hoodie and jeans but thats the power of undiagnosed depression

no way you too??? i heard from a lot of ppl that apparently ADD very often goes undiagnosed in afab kids, and VERY often in afab adults....
Suicide, undiagnosed cancer, heart disease etc, otherwise easily treatable conditions like diabetes, epilepsy etc and things like domestic abuse and alcoholism will kill ten times more than 'covid 19' precisely because of the lock down. The 'cure' is much worse than the disease
also it's bizarre that you extrapolate tens of millions of undiagnosed cases but fail to extrapolate any undiagnosed fatalities? like i understand that serious cases are more likely to be diagnosed, but then, you're the one pretending selection bias doesn't exist

Still true. David French's chastisements of Evangelical Trump voters are riddled with inconsistencies, misplaced priorities, virtue signaling, offensiveness, and myopia. Now they are tedious as well.
Too often, autistic girls go through school undiagnosed or unrecognised as being autistic. As a late-diagnosed autistic woman, I thought I would share a thread on my experiences of going through the education system. (Pls share with those who work in education/anyone interested)

That is, obsession w/ producing what we call green energy as a panacea that is a hallmark of modern US green groups. But obsession w/ population control w/ no real class analysis is myopia of Gibbs/Zehner. Also, many solutions found in Zehner's book didn't make it into (1/2)

My latest audiobook narration was a tough subject but an important one. BPD affects millions of people and many go undiagnosed. This book sheds light on the stigma and struggles of this disorder as well as the hope that proper treatment provides.
Serology testing done thus far indicates infection is very widespread. LA County, CA has hundreds of thousands of undiagnosed cases per their serology testing. The good news is that the virus isn't likely dangerous to you. The bad news is you'll never eradicate it.

I am undiagnosed but I will admit a deep seeded need to know the truth has been a constant struggle my whole life
I've been tweeting this for weeks, there is a huge price to pay for this lockdown, not just deaths due to suicide, but undiagnosed cancer, stroke, heart disease...the list goes on. Something has to be done.
Echolalia being so stimmy to say is right up there with dyslexia being so hard to spell.
Both typhus and Lyme disease are caused by tick bites, and both can be serious if undiagnosed in the early stages. But what is typhus exactly and how is it different from Lyme?

It amounted to a gang of self-indulgent windbags waffling whilst displaying various stupors and undiagnosed psychological issues. 
I like the part where they put us all on the autism spectrum then proceeded to try forcing lies down our throats...

What those trying to downplay the mortality rate of COVID-19 to justify their evil conveniently pretend to forget is that many with the "seasonal flu" may also be "asymptomatic cases or undiagnosed people who recover at home" thus reducing its mortality rate.
my optometrist and 600 degree myopia disagree with you but um
Sis the cat has some issues with its sensory. It is Ataxia. In general, it's a condition relating to a sensory dysfunction that produces loss of coordination of the limbs, head, and/or trunk.
It would be interesting to see a photo of the family. There was a similar story on the news about a family of 9 and 4 died. A  photo showed that there wasn't one of them under 300 pounds... Suggesting a lot of potential undiagnosed pre-existing conditions.
This is on my list of "upside surprise" scenarios... that far more unsymptomatic and/or undiagnosed coronavirus cases have already occurred...

I had flu in early Dec. about a month after my flu shot.  lasted about 2 days.   But I had a "cold" in early March. Daughter in Law started Covid (undiagnosed except by symptoms) the day after my cold started.  Her doc says we got Covid from the baby (who had a cold).
S.U.M.I..sudden undiagnosed mental illness. New defence ...being off your head on ice whilst driving a truck. Words fail Insult to those suffering mental illness Not an excuse to kill people #inhumane
Either our hospital is pathetic, or there are a LOT of more mild cases going undiagnosed.
This paper also got the mortality wrong, because dead people from (undiagnosed) COVID19 don't sign up through Facebook
Would hate to think #VanDerValk is yet one more example of the myopia of #itv executives. Rolling out another tried and tested idea/remake instead of being bold and bringing something new, original and ground breaking to the screens.
Well they talk about Ataxia being a big problem in Cyrodiil (Ataxia is a pretty brutal thing irl evidently), rock joint from infected animal bites (seems similar to streptococcus), Rattles, etc. Probably side effects with allergies (such as garlic with Vicente Valtieri

Agreed - it does seem unfair in any case, even if people who are married with kids were in fact more likely to be trustworthy, it would still be unfair to make assumptions about an individual. Stereotypy is weird. We are categorizing machines.

Well for starters, the definition of autism has expanded to include hundreds of disorders. The other issue is the number of vaccines given in such a short period of time can trigger it in children with certain underlying and undiagnosed conditions. It wont just give it to you.
Zooming out.These media millionaires have facilitated the destruction of journalism. But the whole structure and cartel running the media is the problem. Yes media bashing can be sometimes flippant but there is a serious issue with this establishment but if on the inside, myopia.
The only way 125k people will die as a result of all this is because of the lockdown - cancers and heart disease going undiagnosed and untreated, increased suicides, increased poverty.

No it doesnt just appear, however many women are undiagnosed and the stress and confinement of lockdown might be thing that tips them over from coping. I would love to help these women.

At this point in the pandemic, clinicians are aware of the most symptoms related to COVID-19. To a lesser extent a variety of other symptoms have been reported in coronavirus-afflicted patients, including fatigue, myalgia, rhinorrhea,  sore throat.
Crazy fasciculations and myalgia from ME due to this trip. I average a drive as long as this once a year.

LASIK to maintain it for some years if its worse to the point that it will lead to glaucoma, retina detachment or maculopathy. 
At 1 pm est. exactly 10 years ago today I had a major stroke! I was 48 yrs. old it was caused by an undiagnosed hole in my heart whic has since been repaired. It affected my left side. After 8 mos of rehab and very hard work I completely recovered! You would never know! 
What I mean is that the obstacles we overcome are not always our own doing, we don't make it easier for sure, but I don't know why, every virgos I know have been undiagnosed/misdiagnosed at some point
Dang. Just took a google search deep dive into all things hypo-/hyperkakemia. Checking all the boxes.  I read about Potassium issues in ppl w/ EDS. And yes, a lot about Chiari as well. But I had a brain MRI in 2018 to check for MS lesions. There don't seem to be issues there.

it's not the deathtoll of coronavirus patients, it's the deathtoll of diagnosed patients. still there should be undiagnosed patients in thousands.
when it starts to get crippling anxiety and it goes undiagnosed and you dont know exactly what you are feeling that was dark. a dark period.

Speaking from both personal  professional experience, I think the speed/coke not only fueled his sex addiction but it also treated his probably undiagnosed ADHD. 
South Africans have opted not to their change the constitution because they understand, theoretically, it is the best in the world, but those virtues need to be translated into practical ones or else this country is going to descend into chaos because of the myopia of its rulers!
Episode 7 of Quarantine and Chill is here on the Disability After Dark feed.  I chat with my friend Jase Grimm (you may know his voice!) as we talk about his experiences with undiagnosed invisible illnesses during the pandemic, is he disabled, and more.
I don't get sick, except for the strange undiagnosed afflictions a couple years ago. That wasn't "flu", at least that they vax for.
Extremely unfortunate. Cardiac arrest is not the cause of death, generally. It is the end point. The cause might be myocardial infarction(heart attack) or undiagnosed undiagnosed rhythm disorder. Stress, irregular eating and sleeping habits, h/o heart attack esp paternal side.
able-bodied folks should be talking about this more too. the fact is that MANY people have undiagnosed conditions or chronic illnesses. MANY people are likely much more vulnerable to #covid than they might know. (2/3)
RT Undiagnosed mental illness? It's actually quite sad.

I think the feelings in sociality can cause those with ADHD and asperger's to understand one another (my best friend has ASD). But I have no signs of ASD and my friend has no signed of ADHD. So I think it might be that you could have undiagnosed ASD too.
Im unable to work due to an undiagnosed stomach illness and almost 4mo pregnant on top of it.. my boyfriend and I live on our own and can afford essentials but being able to have extra funds to prepare for baby and fix up our old car would help so much #jeffreestarapproved 
Liberals and silent majority is suffering by ostrich syndrome.
Ok so CFR is deaths among diagnosed patients. IFR attempts to include asymptomatic and undiagnosed in the calculation
i love at home learning but the undiagnosed adhd is rlly popping out
By definition, only potentially infectious are quarantined. The rest would be just a shutdowns to prevent spread of undiagnosed. It is semantical but without consistent definitions, conversation goes awry
We're living through history. It's a pity that we don't have thought leaders who can guide us through this period and the changes that will follow it. South Africa will become a superpower or it will fall under its own weight as a result of the myopia of its rulers...
It's from a book by Larry Sutton (psychologist  deacon) on ministering to autistic children  teens. (I would rework it to avoid "functioning", but otherwise think it's pretty good.)
POTUS was taking action, and the media was all a-Twitter about Impeachment. Jan 22, only the BBC carried an "after the break" impeachment story, all other stories there, AFP, Middle East press were all CoVID. US Media myopia and rewriting history will not fly.
Dont you know,  everything now takes a backseat to covid. Who cares if you go 6 months undiagnosed or without medical care

This is why it's wrong to discourage "repetitive behaviors" - because they can be part of that process. A friend taught a kid who kept drawing the same lamp over and over, then suddenly produced an exquisitely detailed picture of an entire room based around that lamp.

Any hx of numbness or other neurologic episode in past? Do detailed exam of extraocular movements, while observing for any nystagmus. Check visual acuity on L vs R visual fields. Test for normal saccades. Perform thorough sensory exam. Examine for ataxia/cerebellar dysfunction.
I rebinged all of Parks and Rec when I had a mysterious undiagnosed flu a few weeks ago (I live in New York City). I wanted something that would make me smile and feel like home. THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER.
There have to be tests to run. Where the hell are they? You and gave been promising millions of tests for weeks. Only 1% of people have been tested. Can't reopen if 99% of the population is undiagnosed. #TrumpVirus #DeadlyLies #TrumpVirusTestingFailure

Italian cases, GBS symptoms began 5-10 days after first COVID-19 symptoms. 4 patients had onset with lower-limb weakness  paresthesias; 1had facial diplegia, then ataxia  paresthesia. 4/5 developed generalized flaccid tetraplegia,  3 patients required mechanical ventilation.
Pretty crazy how you think I am somehow related to him in anyway. Just pointing out the blatant myopia in people like you. Also your botted followers aren't even going to see this, no point in quoting my tweet there bro.
Wouldn't it be more accurate to say "5% of all  cases end in death"? Given that a significant percentage of infections go undiagnosed, doesn't that mean the fatality rate is inflated due to sampling bias, since asymptomatic carriers don't enter those statistics?

All Dads Have Undiagnosed Autism
This "argument" fails to recognize that MANY people have *undiagnosed* underlying conditions. Also, one of those underlying conditions is OBESITY, so I'd say that significantly increases the number of those at risk.

One major difference between Sweden and NY is that we're much less inclined to admit the most frail elderly patients to hospitals, let alone the ICU. Expect a few hundred covid patients have died in our nursing homes, undiagnosed, without coming anywhere near a hospital.
Dr said he obtained annual death figs for all other causes over last 3 years  the figs stay around same until Covid 19 when they dropped to hardly any as Nurses  Drs said they've been told all deaths now to be C.19  No P.mortems means deaths that r undiagnosed cond not known.

My hunch is that Covid-19 has already spread on a fairly large scale in our country. It's just that there are many undiagnosed/asymptomatic cases roaming around. Not sure our testing capacity can match that. Govt. doesn't seem bothered to enfroce a strict lockdown either.

"Echolalia" brought me to a definition with the words "mindless repetition", when children with autism exhibiting echolalia often use the words they hear not only to repeat language, but to convey the meaning they associate with those words. Do better Google.

I'm also curious about the actual numbers and what undiagnosed comorbidities these young people had. High BP isnt as uncommon anymore in young people. They say "dozens" in the article with no other info.
the government has banned alcohol with great reason. But also theres cigarettes which is basically the bread and butter for most people with their undiagnosed mental illness or just needing a cigarette to fucking chill. Thank god for the black market some times. (2)

Yes good news.  Do you happen to know if flu death rates also take into account undiagnosed cases?  Surely not as many as this but youd think at least a small amount?
One clear to me clue this is working is that while I subject my bladder to the magnetic pulses I am experiencing hot flushes, myalgia  profuse sweat, all signs of immune system working to eliminate waste from my blood 'aka' JarischHerxheimer reaction.

I don't know why some people condemn gathering at Late Abba Kyari's funeral. This calls to question whether we want to run a communist state or capitalist one.

This is a little off topic but I would like 2 start sharing things I find interesting. Did you know 49% of humans have a type of ADD/ADHD AND THEY ARE UNDIAGNOSED!? ME NEITHER! This was amazing. So informative. I hope it helps someone out there MUCH LOVE
This is scary, people, because none were difficult diagnoses of rare diseases 1/
The claim "Americans are being told they must play by New York rules" is just wrong. Does Stephens really think public health experts don't understand the rest of America (and the world!) isn't like New York? Why encourage this kind of know-nothingism?

The problem is the implication carried by suggestions that the Tories have planned a Nazi-style onslaught on sections of the population. Understandably,   have little idea of the pit they are digging. Their politics demand myopia over History.
Not sure theres enough currently undiagnosed COVID cases out there right now to hit these goals but I suppose that doesnt matter when this is all one big lie anyway
Exactly. The G/T characteristics can create their own problems, too. A kid may fit in easily with adults but gets bullied by peers. Or have emotional-development needs that are masked by an advanced vocabulary. Or have undiagnosed BD/LD issues hidden by academic achievement.

The best bit about Toynbee's myopia is that, along with the rest of her cabal of frothing pretend socialists (Socialism for the masses, not for me!) she will never grasp quite how far away from the public mood she actually is.
I get the fact that people change, but to me, doing chores ain't a biggy, and shouldn't be. I get the guy comes home and he's tired, same thing with the lady. At least do the  her cook. Then again housemaids(hate to use this word) are there to handle that.

may I suggest a 3rd option?  It has been here longer than previously known and first cases were healthy people travelling or people who died undiagnosed.  I have anecdotal evidence (client stories) to support, need antibody tests.

Similarly, when I was 7 I missed about 3 months of school for some weird, and eventually undiagnosed, illness - no home schooling but seemingly no effect on my overall education
If people will do social distancing.. people should be out in the fresh air. Ultimately we need to figure out how to protect the most vulnerable while not killing our economy and the unintended consequence of shutdown..domestic/child abuse..undiagnosed illness and mental decline
there will be a rude shock once they increase testing, wouldnt be surprised if there is large number of undiagnosed cases.

There's always been slanging btw generations. Considering the large amount of selfishness and myopia shown by most fellow boomers, there's not much ground for complaint.
Curious if one possible explanation for the asymmetry is undiagnosed cases at the front end vs more comprehensive case identification on the tail end. (Although imperfect modeling is still high on the differential.)

If you are getting this type of feedback often, perhaps it would be best for you to take the suggestions seriously. Undiagnosed mental illness leads to alcohol  drug abuse. Take good care during these stressful days.

You are so right. The GOP stole 2000 in the open, swindled 2004 through some mass myopia and 2016 went full George Orwell. Republicans must win the White House this year to avoid prison and cannot possibly win a fair vote. Therefore expect cancellation, invalidation and violence.

I am undiagnosed (doctors here have barely heard of EDS) but I know that. Good to read that others experience it too.
Not necessarily, no. In every single case I've seen of "healthy person dies" it is only presumed healthy and without medical records. And there's no reason to suppose medical staff go digging to ensure there wasn't an undiagnosed condition either.

There wont be a surge in deaths necessarily because this virus doesnt kill nearly as many people under 60. No matter when you open there will be a case surge. In the US alone we now have 1 million undiagnosed cancer cases but the media wont tell you that. More to worry about
Cancer is not a surgery. And those people would be undiagnosed anyway because in this country people avoid going to the doctor so they dont go broke even WITH health insurance.

No. Its moderately good news. It means the worst case scenario is only 3 times as bad as NYC. But its also somewhat bad news because it means 0.5% of infected have died already not counting the ones who will die and the ones who died undiagnosed, so 1% is more realistic.

There have been 30,000 more deaths from pneumonia than the corona virus since February 1st. Also the number of people reported to have coronavirus is way higher since most people go without symptoms or undiagnosed. Therefore the death rate is no where near accurate #facts
How can the true case fatality rate be 0.1%, if in New York State confirmed deaths are already over 0.11% (21,800/19,500,000)? True CFR must be higher than 0.11% because many in NYS have not been sick, many have died undiagnosed  many more will die in coming months.

Thanks - here's direct guidance from the GMC.  It's plain from the GMC's answers that doctors should  not apply a blanket rule of "no PPE, no treatment" but should use their judgement on level of risk/harm to patient, self and other factors. Worth a careful read.

It would stand to reason that if cases have been/are being undiagnosed, deaths are also being under/not reported. Unless it's just confirmed cases that are fatal, which seems unlikely. But if you want to take you and yours to a full arena as soon as you possibly can, have at it.

Evidently you dont know math. Its estimated that 85% of the COVID-19 cases go undiagnosed - 2 studies. So that means there are really 4.7M cases which bring the survival rate with the padded 37K deaths to 99.2% or a mortality rate of 0.8%.
