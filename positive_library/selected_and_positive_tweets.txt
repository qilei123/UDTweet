When I say I stay up super late aha! Its not because I want to, it is rather due to the fact that I run through all the ways I could possibly be actively dying and have no idea and then I work myself into a panic that I have an undiagnosed disease ravaging my body
I haven't heard of it before, but it seems like he had an undiagnosed disease, that's tragic.
me, 11 oclock pm on a monday night: * looking up my symptoms, convinced im going to die because of an undiagnosed disease*
I know I go on the same rant at least once a month but it really gets under my skin. Justin struggled for a year and a half because of an undiagnosed disease, gets a diagnosis, is brave enough to share it with millions of people then gets made fun of and bullied for having ticks
He suffers from another undiagnosed disease; SFBS. The medical term is Shit For Brains Syndrome. Affects many in the Liberal Media.
Tim Schedl talks about the #Celegans model for RAB5B identified from Undiagnosed Diseases Network UDB256694. The lesion present in the patient acts as an antimorph/dominant negative. #TAGC2020

not to self diagnose but i feel like im a slight hypochondriac.. im constantly feeling like im dying of an undiagnosed disease
Sure...according to his wife. I am retracting my claim of cancer survival since I cannot cute evidence to support it. However, the guys pics *clearly* show signs of underlying conditions. Likely undiagnosed.
this quarantine rlly be making my undiagnosed depression become more and more apparent
Someone with too many children, no support network, and probably some undiagnosed mental health issues. idk, I just don't know how to tell her to love her child?
Just the news about the truck driver in the eastern. Undiagnosed mental health issue for his whole life....just got me thinking.
Now that we have examined the strange death of Joan Rivers, here is the autopsy report on an even STRANGER death, Lori Klausutis, a 28 year old woman whom they say had an undiagnosed heart condition (she ran 8K marathons though). Exhumation anyone?
I had these symptoms for a long time, and it turned out part of the problem was undiagnosed whiplash, so physio untangled that and no more of those symptoms and don't need traction anymore. Still have lots of other problems from Lyme though.
V at 20. Coping horribly with undiagnosed mental health issues/ personality disorder with drinks every  of drugs. 200lbs, eating like garbage, not facing any of my past, depressed with daily panic  surviving day to day. Idk how I'm still here but I made it
Artuad spent much of his later life, in and out of Asylums with undiagnosed  schizophrenia.
But many seriously ill do not qualify as the list is so restrictive - Mum 80+, undiagnosed digestive issues, IBS, angina, pacemaker and still healing from broken wrist and arm (opposite arms) but not qualify. Family all live far away .......

#MeAt20 got me looking through old photos.. complete with (probably) cider, Hello Kitty watch, rainbow button necklace, baggy dress and blazer done up to hide my body shape, and tights and boots because that was "my thing"... And suffering from undiagnosed severe PTSD. My child.
This is exactly why I spoke about me suffering from Crohn's Disease very publicly. Ever since then, more than 40 people approached me and told me they were suffering from similar symptoms but have gone undiagnosed for years because doctors couldn't figure out why or-
In the 5 years I have been investigating my undiagnosed digestive issues I have gone from a purely western "traditional medicine" approach to where I am now, 1000 tests later, taking four different supplements daily that I buy off the internet. If it works, it works!!
Maybe he's born with it, maybe it's Undiagnosed ADD
Many marriages have been destroyed, not by the usual marital problems, but by undiagnosed mental illnesses.
Ataxia Telangiectasia is the condition of my son Ryler also. It has been a challenge to do a day activities. He lost his ability to walk about a year ago. He is 12. Any info your family has I would love to hear about this no cure and rare disease
A young girl living with systemic #mastocytosis fulfilled her dream of meeting her role model. Watch the inspiring story here, courtesy of
Systemic mastocytosis associated with Hodgkins lymphoma in a 4-year-oldchild
Hope so.. A friend's kid has mastocytosis AND tuberous sclerosis, somehow. Known folks with all sorts of things that come with compromised or reduced immune systems, or have other issues. Tbh, it wouldn't even matter if I knew someone personally, I'd still be worried about that..
I have MS  my grandsons live with me the 5 yr old has Mastocytosis
Yeah, wow. I love it because I get to drink water again without throwing up. I might do different since I have systemic mastocytosis and not MCAD. Even though I'm used to it, the different reactions people have to the same meds for similar conditions still blow me away.
I have a rare autoimmune Mastocytosis
It is an autoimmune disorder of the nervous system characterized by new movements of the limbs and eyes, abnormal behaviors, sleep dysregulation, and difficulty talking.

People at my school be such kiss-asses. Our professor had dysphonia so she has someone else teaching her slides while she clarifies.
Due to a neurological condition called spasmodic dysphonia and treatments for it, I might sound a little different every time you hear me speak.
Kennedy Jr suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, which makes him difficult to listen to.  He is not anti-vaccine he is pro-safe-vaccines.  Listen from 18.16 - 28.32.  Diabetes, autism, allergies are caused by UNTESTED vaccines. Children today are supposed to take 72.
Alhumdulilah Alhumdulilah Alhumdulilah! He tolerated thick liquids today, got NG tube out, dysphonia slightly improved and was able to get up to a chair! All thanks to everyones prayers! Please pray he continues to build on these small steps daily iA #_

He has a disorder called Spasmodic dysphonia that causes the shaky voice.
I have panhypopituitarism and my endo has said that my chronic fatigue is all in my mind..is this the case?
I also have panhypopituitarism and suffer from chronic fatigue my endocrinologist is very supportive it has to do with your hormone levels.
I know I  don't!  The steroids I take for panhypopituitarism make me crave more sugar especially after eating something higher in carbs.
condition called Panhypopituitarism, which means that my pituitary gland doesnt produce enough of/any of the hormones it is supposed to normally. For example, it is why I had to be treated with synthetic HGH as a child because I wasnt growing. In 10 I went to
IV pain medicine, and some stress dosing steroids b/c I was having an adrenal crisis due to my Panhypopituitarism (FYI, this was about 12:30 AM). She was finally successful  they set me up with IV fluids, strong pain medication, etc. The GI on duty that AM
I got hypopigmentation on my nose any suggestions from my skin sisters/brothers!!!!???????
What can I do to treat hypopigmentation?
I didnt have enough characters but basically another laser can be used to reverse laser induced hypopigmentation. Have you dermatologist check out the hypopigmentation always and wear your SPF 
im hoping mine goes away. i struggled with eczema for so long just to have hypopigmentation sit in its place??? and its on my face too im tired
I see people are getting hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation mixed up in your tweet replies.  Hypopigmentation is areas of skin that are lighter than everywhere else lol.
I have hypopigmentation, basically my skin loses its pigment when heavily exposed to UV rays (due to melanin depletion). Its cosmetic and the only way I can get rid of it is by whitening my skin which I was against.

We just started to ween him off of Onfi and started Banzel and staying on keppra. Ben is 2 doesnt crawl, sit, or stand. Although we are making progress in. by in. Hypotonia has been a challenge as well. Best wishes to you and your son.
I had a child who had hypotonia and the harness allowed me to pull her up before she fell. It helped her build much needed muscles,  the confidence  security to walk w/o the pain associated of skinned knees   hands. Does religion make people lazy when it comes to judgement?
I hate not being able to do the same things my other percussionist friends can do because of dyspraxia and hypotonia
I get it. My hypotonia presented as severe to the point it looked like the conditions I was misdiagnosed with. So Im not angry or annoyed at all cos my type of EDS is extremely rare. And everyone went out of their way to diagnose me correctly. But yeah thats my story

He could have chosen the words wisely if it was simple feedback but I will surely get my eyes checked bcoz no matter how far or near I keep the phone, can't see u weep or cry. May be new eye disease than Myopia and Hypermetropia .
yes I have, and oddly it was in dating a women who I believed to have had undiagnosed BPD that led me to double binds which led me to dialectical behaviour therapy which led me back to, you guessed it, Hegel. but actually, fear of abandonment is at the root of nearly everything
4 seperate mental health professionals: yeah your daughter almost certainly has a serious undiagnosed anxiety disorder 
That said, I'm sure I was undiagnosed Bipolar all during my early to mid adult years. I am by comparison quite ready steady now.  Cheers

my right arm has been numb since I am pretty sure I had it (undiagnosed.) I was thinking it was carpal tunnel from my twitter use while stuck at home lol. But I have increasingly become a little more worried.
Nothing beats getting older and realizing all the things I used to get irrationally mad at and beat myself up over not making sense was all because I was undiagnosed.
The reason I went undiagnosed is bc I had the symptoms as a teen, it was passed as bad periods. They put me on a high estrogen bc pill - which I was on all the way until pregnancy with my daughter. Pregnancy suppresses the symptoms for 2-3 years. It is now making itself known.

Im so sorry; I have an undiagnosed autoimmune condition and its horrible. I hope the steroids help; they help me but Im still bedridden. Sending lots of love your way!
My ARFID got worse as I wasn't given treatment. I was undiagnosed and not believed. My doctors looked at me patronizingly when I told them I didn't have anorexia. My eating disorder does not come from a desire to be thin. It comes from the insecurity around what i eat-

i probably have like 4 undiagnosed mental illnesses... i already know 2 of them are depression and body dysmorphia
((OOC: That nickname mainly applies to his alternate personality from his undiagnosed mental illness.))
I have been dealing with an undiagnosed movement disorder and had an appointment with a dismissive neurologist who thinks my problems may be "all in my head" yesterday. She referred me to a hypnotist. The hypnotist in question? A fucking rapist!
